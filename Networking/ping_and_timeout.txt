					PING AND TIMEOUT
				========================
- a good network should have little to no time out.
- timeout means that the network disconnects after a certain amount of packets have been sent.
- we can check if a network has timeout using the command:
	EG.
		ping google.com -t
			--> this will send packets until stopped manually by the user.

		ping google.com
			--> will send fixed number of ICMP requests (usually 4) and stop once it gets a response from google or times out waiting for response.

		ping google.com -n (number of packets)
			--> similar to above but you specify the number of ICMP packets to be sent.

		ping -a [ip addr]
			--> this is used to show the dns hostname from the ip address.
			--> it can also be used to know the name of a device connected to the network as long as you have the ip address.
			** does not work in linux.**

		ping -i (seconds) google.com
			--> this will specify the interval(in seconds) between successive pings.
