                            ADB over Wi-Fi (how it works and command pattern)
                        ========================================================
- avoids cables for long debugging sessions or when USB port is busted (but requires initial USB setup and authorization).

Steps:
    i. Connect device to PC via USB (and authorize the PC once).


    ii. Put device into tcpip mode:
        EG.
            adb tcpip 5555          # restarts adbd listening on TCP port 5555

                - To close the open port.
                    EG.
                        adb usb         # to switch back to USB.


    iii. Disconnect USB. find device IP 
        EG.(from phone or)
            adb shell ip -f inet addr show wlan0
            # sample output:
            # 3: wlan0: <...> mtu 1500 qdisc mq state UP group default qlen 3000
            #     inet 192.168.1.42/24 brd 192.168.1.255 scope global wlan0
            #        valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever

                - This prints the IPv4 address and interface details for wlan0.  
                - This discovers the phone's local IP for adb connect.


    iv. Connect over Wi-Fi:
        EG.
            adb connect 192.168.1.42:5555

                - it Connects to the TCP port exposed by the phone.
                - If the phone has a local IP and the PC is on the same LAN, you can connect.
                - If you expose the phone's port to the internet (public IP + port forwarding), theoretically anyone could try to connect over the internet.
                - But since ADB used key-based authentication, it makes it hard unless the pc connecting was already authorized.


    v. adb devices will now show the device over TCP.

NB : Caveat: - if ADB wasn't authorized previously, you still need to accept the RSA dialog on the phone during the initial USB pairing.
