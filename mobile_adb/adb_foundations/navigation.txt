                            NAVIGATING THE ANDROID SHELL AND COMMON LOCATIONS.
                        =======================================================
- Android shell is linux-like. (Bourne shell) sh shell.
- Basic commands available via toybox or toolbox. 
- Use ls, cd, pwd, find, grep (if present).


        Common directories.
    ---------------------------
> /sdcard or /storage/emulated/0 
    - User-accesible internal storage (photos, downloads)

> /storage 
    - mount points (external and internal)

> /data/data/<package>/ 
    - app private data (needs root or run-as)

> /mnt/media_rw/ 
    - Physical storage mounts.

> /system/ and /vendor/ 
    - Read-only system partitions.

        EG.
            adb shell
            # list storage root
            ls -la /storage
            ls -la /sdcard
            # find all jpgs
            find /sdcard -type f -name "*.jpg" -print
            # check sizes
            du -h /sdcard/DCIM | head
            # view WhatsApp media path (common)
            ls -la /sdcard/WhatsApp/Media/
            # search for WhatsApp DB (private)
            find /data -name "msgstore*.db" 2>/dev/null
            # (if run-as/permissions fail 'permission denied' will appear)

                - If a command is missing you can use toybox:
                    EG.
                        toybox find /sdcard -name '*.jpg'

                -


                SH VS BASH.
            -----------------
- sh:  historically refers to the POSIX shell (Bourne shell).
       On modern Linux systems /bin/sh is often a minimal POSIX-compatible shell (dash, ash, or busybox sh) — smaller feature set, faster, and less memory.
       It supports POSIX shell syntax.

- bash: (Bourne Again SHell) is much richer: arrays, [[ ]] test, (( )) arithmetic, brace expansion, advanced parameter expansions, coproc, select, etc.

- Rule of thumb: If a script uses Bash-specific features ([[, arrays, =~ regex operator, process substitution <(...)), it needs bash.
                 If it uses simple POSIX constructs only, it will run in sh.

- You can test if a script is a POSIX shell compatible:
    EG.
        # Run it with sh explicitly.
        sh myscript.sh 
        # run a syntax check with bash (it will accept bashisms)
        bash -n myscript.sh
