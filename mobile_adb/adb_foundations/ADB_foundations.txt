            1. Start the ADB Server and list devices. 
            -------------------------------------------
i. Start / Restart server.
    EG.
        adb kill-server
        adb start-server 


ii. List attached Devices.
    EG.
        adb devices.
        # Output:
        # List of devices attached
        # R58M32AF9XD    device

            - The long ID = device serial (unique identifier)
            - The state after the serial
                > device (authorized) = Selected PC is authorized by the phone ( you can run commands)
                > unauthorized = Phone needs user approval (RSA Prompt) to trust this PC. Happens when you see if the phone popped "Allow USB debugging?".
                > offline = Connection hiccup (USB power/cable/driver issue).


iii. How authorization works (the trusted-PC list)
    - When the phone shows the "Allow USB Debugging?" dialog and you check Always allow, Android adds the PC's ADB public key to the phone's trust list.
    - On the device the list is stored at:
        EG.
            /data/misc/adb/adb_keys   (user-installed keys)
            /adb_keys               (vendor keys embedded at build time)

                - That file is the phone's remembered list of trusted PCs.
                - If your PC is in that file, you can use ADB even if the screen later dies.

                - The PC stores your private adb key locally (usually ~/.android/adbkey and adbkey.pub).
                - The phone only stores the public key entry in /data/misc/adb/adb_keys.
                - This is why an already-authorized PC remains trusted.

                - this files can only be read/access on typically rooted phones.


            2. Understanding Device ID (serial) and what you can learn from it
            -------------------------------------------------------------------
- When adb devices shows:
    EG.
        0123456789abcdef   device

- That serial is the device indentifier exposed by the device and used by ADB to target commands.
- It's not enough by itself to pull private data unless the PC is authorized.
- You can query the device (if authorized) to learn model, manufacturer, Android Version.
    EG.
        adb -s 0123456789abcdef shell getprop ro.product.model
        adb -s 0123456789abcdef shell getprop ro.product.manufacturer
        adb -s 0123456789abcdef shell getprop ro.build.version.release
        # you can use either the serial or the tcp connection if you use over wifi.
        adb -s 192.168.0.103:1111 shell getprop ro.product.model


- So yes — if you have ADB access, that serial plus getprop gives you model/build info.
- If you do not have ADB authorization, the serial alone is just an identifier — not an open door.  


            3. MTP (No ADB required, just user unlock and accept file transfer)
            -----------------------------------------------------------------------
- Media Transfer Protocol.
- It’s a USB protocol (based on PTP) that allows file-level access to media storage on devices without mounting raw block devices.
- Windows communicates with the phone via MTP to show the phone’s storage in Explorer.
- MTP is the normal Windows "Phone" connection (plug phone, choose File transfer on phone).
- Then you can use File Explorer to copy images.
- On linux, use mtpfs or simple-mtpfs to mount; e.g.:
    EG.
        # Linux example using simple-mtpfs (install first)
        simple-mtpfs ~/phone_mount
        cp -r ~/phone_mount/DCIM ~/phone_backup/
        fusermount -u ~/phone_mount

            - When to use which:
                > Use ADB for programmatic extraction, pulling entire directories, or when MTP not available (or you need app data).
                > Use MTP for straightforward user-driven file copy (photos, downloads) when phone can be unlocked.
