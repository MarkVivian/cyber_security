                    EJECTING FLASH DRIVE.
                =========================
- you can use the udisks command to eject a USB drive. 
- First, you need to identify the device name of the USB drive. You can do this by using the lsblk command:
    EG.
        lsblk
            - This will list all the block devices on your system, including the USB drive. 
            - Note down the device name of the USB drive (e.g., /dev/sdb1).

            - To eject a drive we use the command:
                EG. 
                    sudo umount /dev/sdb1

                        - Replace /dev/sdb1 with the actual partition name.


            - Safely eject the USB drive (optional)
                EG.
                    sudo eject /dev/sdb

                        - Replace /dev/sdb with the actual device name (note that this is the device, not the partition).



                    FORMATTING DRIVE.
                ======================
- To format a drive in Linux, you will typically use 
    > fdisk
    > parted for partitioning 
    > mkfs for formatting. 


- Open the fdisk utility using:
    EG.
        sudo fdisk /dev/sdb 

            - Replace /dev/sdb with your target disk.

            - In the prompt we can :
                
                - Clean the disk by deleting all partitions.
                    EG.
                        type `d`

                            - delete all existing partitions by typing d and then selecting the partition number. Repeat for all partitions.

                - Creating a new primary partition.
                    EG.
                        type `n`

                            - type n to create a new partition, then p for primary, and follow the prompts to specify the partition size.

                - Write changes and exit.
                    EG.
                        type `w`
                            
                            - Type w to write the changes to the disk and exit fdisk.

                - After creating a new partition (e.g., /dev/sdb1), format it with the desired file system (e.g., ext4):

                    - Format the partition with a filesystem:
                        EG.
                            sudo mkfs.ext4 /dev/sdb1

                            - Replace ext4 with the desired file system type (e.g., ntfs, fat32, etc.).


- Assign a mount point (optional)
    EG.
        sudo mount /dev/sdb1 /mnt

            - Replace /mnt with the desired mount point
