                                USING DEV
                            ====================
- the /dev directory contains device files.
- This files represent hardware devices and virtual devices on your system.

            TYPES OF DEVICES.
        =======================
1. Block Devices.
    - These devices read and write data one character at a time.
        EG.
            /dev/sda
            /dev/sdb


2. character devices
    - these devices read and write data one character at a time.
        EG. 
            /dev/ttyS0 (a serial port)
            /dev/input/mice (a mouse)


3. special files.
    - these include files like :
        EG.
            /dev/null: Discards all data written to it (acts like a "black hole").
            /dev/zero: Provides an endless stream of zeroes.`
            /dev/urandom: Provides an endless stream of random data.`
