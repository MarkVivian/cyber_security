                                MOUNTING
                            ====================
Mounting : 
    -  The process of making a filesystem accessible at a certain point in the directory tree. 
    - When you mount a device (like a USB drive or a partition), you link it to a directory so that you can access its contents.


filesystem :    
    - The structure and logic rules used to manage the storage and retrieval of data on a disk.


mount point :
    - The directory in the existing filesystem where the device's filesystem is attached (mounted).


The /mnt Directory

    Purpose: Historically, /mnt is a directory where temporary mounts can be made. It's a common practice to use /mnt for mounting devices manually for tasks like data recovery, troubleshooting, or temporary access.
    Standard Locations:
        /mnt: For temporary mounts.
        /media: Typically used by the system for auto-mounting removable media (e.g., USB drives, CDs).



MOUNTING A DEVICE 
-----------------------
- Steps for Mounting a Device Manually
    1. Identify the Device:    
        - Use lsblk or fdisk -l to list all block devices and their partitions.
            EG.
                sudo lsblk
                    OR
                sudo fdisk -l

    2. Create a Mount Point:
        - Choose or create a directory where you want to mount the device.
        - For temporary mounts, you can use /mnt or create a subdirectory within it.
            EG.
                sudo mkdir -p /mnt/mydevice

    3. Mount the Device:
        - Use the mount command to attach the filesystem on the device to the directory.
            EG.
                sudo mount /dev/sdXn /mnt/mydevice

                    - Replace /dev/sdXn with the appropriate device identifier (e.g., /dev/sda1).

    4. Access the Mounted Filesystem:
        - Once mounted, you can access the files on the device through the mount point directory.
            EG.
                ls /mnt/mydevice


PRATICAL EXAMPLES
-----------------------
+++++++Example 1: Mounting a USB Drive+++++++++++
1. Identify the USB Drive:
    EG.
        sudo lsblk
            
            - Assume the USB drive is identified as /dev/sdb1.


2. Create a Mount Point:
    EG.
        sudo mkdir -p /mnt/usbdrive


3. Mount the USB Drive:
    EG.
        sudo mount /dev/sdb1 /mnt/usbdrive


4. Access the USB Drive:
    EG.
        ls /mnt/usbdrive



++++++++++Example 2: Mounting an ISO File+++++++++++++
1. Create a Mount Point:
    EG.
        sudo mkdir -p /mnt/iso


2. Mount the ISO File:
    EG.
        sudo mount -o loop /path/to/yourfile.iso /mnt/iso


3. Access the Mounted ISO:
    EG.
        ls /mnt/iso


                UMOUNTING A DEVICE.
            ==========================
Unmounting: 
    > The process of detaching the filesystem from the directory tree.

Command:
    EG.
        sudo umount /mnt/mydevice

            - Ensure no processes are using the mount point directory.
            - If it's busy, you may need to close files or change directories.


            AUTO-MOUNTING WITH /etc/fstab.
            ===================================
Persistent Mounts: 
    - To automatically mount filesystems at boot time, you can configure /etc/fstab.
    
Format in /etc/fstab:
    EG.
        /dev/sdXn  /mnt/mydevice  ext4  defaults  0  2

            - Replace /dev/sdXn with your device,
            - /mnt/mydevice with your mount point,
            -  and ext4 with the filesystem type.
