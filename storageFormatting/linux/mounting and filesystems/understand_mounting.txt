    - When you mount a device (like a USB drive or a partition), you link it to a directory so that you can access its contents.


filesystem :    
    - The structure and logic rules used to manage the storage and retrieval of data on a disk.


mount point :
    - The directory in the existing filesystem where the device's filesystem is attached (mounted).
