-You need a wifi adapter that supports monitor mode.
-This is a python script.
-Must be run in root.

				USAGE
				======
- run wifite in sudo mode
	EG.
		sudo wifite

	- since there might be some conflicting system processes we run:
		EG.
			sudo wifite --kill

-This will show all the networks available or that are being detected by your wifi interface.
	-There are some column headers that are good to know

		ESSID :- the network the wifi interface is detecting.
	
		CH :- channel
	
		ENCR :- encryption type.
	
		PWR :- strength of the wifi.
	
		WPS :- whether it supports wps or not.
	
		CLIENT :- how many users the network has at the moment.


- You can also specify the dictionary that wifite uses to hack into the wifi.
	EG.
		sudo wifite --dict ./file --kill

- You can also specify the type of wifi you want to crack like wpa.
	EG.
		sudo wifite --wpa --dict ./file --kill


							-*- NOTE -*- 
							=============
	- it leaves the wifi card in monitor mode.
	-do disable this we use the following commands.
 		EG.
 			ip link set wlp2s0 down
 				AND
    		iw wlp2s0 set type managed
 		   		AND
 		   ip link set wlp2s0 up
				AND
			service NetworkManager start
