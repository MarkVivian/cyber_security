-sU => used for UDP connections... sends packets to the target machine without expecting any response from the target		ICMP packets will send a message to show if the port is closed.

-sT => used for TCP connections...sends a syn flag to the target which response with a SYN/ACK flag if the port is 		open else RST if the port is closed and the host responsed with the ACK flag to finish the connection.

-sn => used for ICMP (ping) sweep but not scanning the ports unlike the others.

-sS => used for SYN/stealth/half-open connections. it works similar to the tcp scans its only that the tcp scan host 
		machine response with a ACK flag but a SYN scan responds with a RST flag.

-O => used to state the os of the target machine.

-sX => used for xmas connections.. where it sends a malformed tcp flag to the host machine and expects a RST flag if 
 	   the port is closed. 

-sF => used for FIN connections where it sends a FIN flag which is used to close any active connections.

-sN => used for null connections.. where it sends an empty tcp request and expects a RST if the port is closed.

-sV => used to detect the version of the service that runs in the target machine.

-v => used to increase the verbosity/the amount of data being received from the nmap scan.

-vv => this is the verbosity of level 2. its highly recommended.

-oA => used to save the ouput of the nmap scan in 3 major formats.

-oN => used to save the format of the nmap scan in normal format.

-oG => used to save the format of the results in a grepable format.very useful ouput.

-A => activates the aggressive mode which which activates the service detection, operating system detection, a
	  traceroute and common script scanning.

-T => used to increase the speed your scans runs at but the faster the speed the noisier you are. T5 sets the speed
 	  to level 5.

-p <port number> => allows us to choose which port to scan on the ip address, like -p 80 scans port 80.
					you can also give it a range of ports to scan using -p 100-150 that scans the ports in the range.
					you can also tell it to scan all ports using -p- .


-Pn => Treat all hosts as online -- skip host discovery

--top-ports => its used to scan a range of ports similar to -p but instead of scanning all the ports in the range 
				it scans all the common ports that are usually in the range.
