The Nmap Scripting Engine (NSE) is an incredibly powerful addition to Nmap, extending its functionality quite considerably. NSE Scripts are written in the Lua programming language, and can be used to do a variety of things: from scanning for vulnerabilities, to automating exploits for them. The NSE is particularly useful for reconnaisance, however, it is well worth bearing in mind how extensive the script library is.

There are many categories available. Some useful categories include:

safe:- Won't affect the target
intrusive:- Not safe: likely to affect the target
vuln:- Scan for vulnerabilities
exploit:- Attempt to exploit a vulnerability
auth:- Attempt to bypass authentication for running services (e.g. Log into an FTP server anonymously)
brute:- Attempt to bruteforce credentials for running services
discovery:- Attempt to query running services for further information about the network (e.g. query an SNMP server).
A more exhaustive list can be found here.

In the next task we'll look at how to interact with the NSE and make use of the scripts in these categories.
