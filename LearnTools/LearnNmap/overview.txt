3 basic scans types are:
    1. TCP connection scans (-sT)
    2. SYN "Half-open" Scans (-sS)
    3. UDP Scans (-sU)

Additionally there are several less common port scan types, some of which we will also cover (albeit in less detail). These are:
    1. TCP Null Scans (-sN)
    2. TCP FIN Scans (-sF)
    3. TCP Xmas Scans (-sX)
