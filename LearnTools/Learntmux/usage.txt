- It allows us to create multiple instances of a terminal (window) and run smaller version of the terminal (panes) in one massive terminal.
- To install:
	EG.
		sudo apt install tmux

* WHEN USING CTRL + B IT ONLY WORKS WITH ONE COMMAND MEANING IF PRESSED THEN A COMMAND IS PRESSED LIKE % OR "" IF YOU WISH TO DO IT AGAIN IT WILL REQUIRE YOU TO REPRESS IT AGAIN*


					USAGE
					======
		*CREATION*
		------------
- Simple way of activating the tmux we use:
	EG.
		tmux

	- This will create window which is basically another terminal.


	- If you want to give the window a name you can use
		EG.
			tmux new -s newWindow --> tmux new -s <name of window>


		*RUNNING TERMINALS*
		--------------------
- to check the open/ running tmux we use:
	EG.
		tmux ls

	- this will show all the running tmux



		*DELETING/KILLING*
		--------------------
- We kill the windows sessions using the command.
	EG.
		tmux kill-session

	- This will delete the most recent session of the tmux / the last opened window.


	- If you have multiple sessions and want to delete a specific
		EG.
			tmux kill-session -t newWindow --> tmux kill-session -t <name of window to delete>
				OR
			tmux kill-session -t 0 --> tmux kill-session -t <index of the window if no name given> 

				t :- target. the window you wish to use.


		- If you want to remove all the sessions at once.
			EG.
				tmux kill-server


		*CLOSING AND DETATCHING*
		---------------------------
- If you wish to detatch a tmux / close but leave the functionality running.
	EG.
		press CTRL + B
			AND
		press D

			CTRL + B :- its a prefix key that makes the tmux listen for what command you want to give it.

			D :- will detatch the window allowing you to go back to the normal terminal.


- If you want to close the tmux completely :
	EG.
		exit


		*REOPENING*
		------------
-if you wish to access any of the running tmux windows we use:
	EG.
		tmux a

	- This will access the recently closed tmux window.


	-if you want open a specific window:
		EG.
			tmux a -t newWindow --> tmux kill-session -t <name of window to delete>
				OR
			tmux a -t 0 --> tmux kill-session -t <index of the window if no name given> 

				t :- target. the window you wish to use.


		*PANE CREATION*
		---------------------
- If you want to create panes inside a window we use:
	EG.
		press CTRL + B
			AND
		press % (SHIFT + 5)

		- this will add a pane to the right
			| window | pane | 


	- If you want to add the pane to the bottom we use:
		EG.
			press CTRL + B
				AND
			press "" (SHIFT + 2)

			- this will add a pane to the bottom.
				| window |
				----------
				|  pane  |


		*PANE NAVIGATION*
		-------------------
- If you wish to navigate through the panes we use:
	EG.
		press CTRL + B
			AND
		press ARROW KEY
			

	- If you want to move more consisly you can use:
		EG.
			press CTRL + B
				AND
			press Q
				AND
			press 2 --> press <index of the pane you want to go to.>

			- it will show indexes of the panes and press the index of the pane you wish to go to.
				|  0 | 1  |
				----------
				|  2 |  3 |

			- NB :- the indexes are on a timer and if not clicked on time you will have to repress the ctrl + b and q again.


		*PANE RESIZING*
		---------------
- If you want to resize a pane you can use:
	EG.
		press CTRL + B
			AND
		press CTRL + ARROW

		- it will manipulate the size according to the arrow key used.


	- If you want to resize the panes by larger sizes:
		EG.
			press CTRL + B
				AND
			press ALT + ARROW


	- If you want to use a layout that is already preset you can use:
		EG.
			press CTRL + B
				AND
			press ALT + 2 --> press ALT + <1 - 5>

				1 :- formation
					|  pane1 | pane2 | pane3 |

				2 :- formation
					| pane1 |
					---------
					| pane2 |
					---------
					| pane3 |

				3 :- formation
					| 			pane1		 |
					--------------------------
					|  pane2 | pane3 | pane4 |

				4 :- formation
					| 			| pane2 |
					|			|-------|
					|  pane 1   | pane3 |
					|			|-------|
					|			| pane4 |
					|			|-------|

				5 :- formation
					|	pane1 | pane2 |
					|---------|-------|
					|  pane3  | pane4 |
					|---------|-------|


		*PANEL CLOSING*
		---------------
- We close panels using the command:
	EG.
		exit

			OR

		press CTRL + B
			AND
		press X


	- If you want to delete all the panes at the same time:
		EG.
			press CTRL + B

			- It will ask whether you want to delete or not. (y or n)


		*CREATING NEW WINDOWS *
		-----------------------

		*NAVIGATING WINDOWS*
		--------------------
- We can navigate windows using:

		- It will move along the windows sequencially.


	- An easier way to move arround is using:
		EG.
			press CTRL + B
				AND
			press W

			- It will show you all the tmux and its windows .
			- Select a window or timux and it will switch to it.

		Steps to Merge Two tmux Windows into One with Panes:
	--------------------------------------------------------------
- Switch to the target window (the one where you want to bring the second window in as a pane):
	EG.
		ctrl + b  1

			> (Replace 1 with the window number where you want to merge the other window.)

 
- Join the second window as a pane:
	EG.
		ctrl + b  :join-pane -s 2

			> (Replace 2 with the window number you want to move.)
