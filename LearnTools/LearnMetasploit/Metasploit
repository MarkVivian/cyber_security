				INTRODUCTION TO METASPLOIT
				---------------------------
Core Commands
===============
	msfstart :- starts the metasploit.
	msfstop :-	stops the metasploit.
	msfconsole :-	enters the metasploit console.

				LEARN METASPLOIT
				-----------------
Core Commands
==============
	search <exploit> :- this allows you to look up vulnarabilities/exploits related to the searched keyword.
		EG.
			search bluetooth


	use <exploit> / use # :- this allows you to use a vulnarability/exploit of your choosing.
		EG.
			use exploit/windows/local/bthpan
				OR
			use 0


	set <>

				EXPLAINING METASPLOIT TERMS
				----------------------------
search <exploit> :
==================
	1) Name :- The name of the module. This is how you reference and select a specific module for use.


	2) Discloser date :- The date when the vulnerability or exploit was publicly disclosed. Knowing the disclosure date helps to 
						 understand the age of the vulnerability and whether it might have received patches or updates.


	3) Rank :- The rank or severity level of the vulnerability. It typically ranges from "Excellent" to "Normal" to "Low" and helps to 
			   prioritize the importance of the vulnerability.
			   			TYPES
			   			=====
			   =Excellent: Modules with a high level of reliability and potential impact. These are often well-tested and proven exploits.

			   =Great: Modules with a significant impact but may not be as reliable or may have specific conditions for success.

			   =Good: Modules that are generally reliable but might have certain limitations or conditions.

			   =Normal: Modules with a moderate level of impact. These may require specific conditions to be met or have limitations.

			   =Low: Modules with a lower level of impact. These might be less reliable or have significant limitations.


	4) Check :- This column indicates whether the module has an associated "check" or "verification" module. A check module is designed 
				to determine whether a target is vulnerable to a specific exploit without actually exploiting it.
			  -In other words it allows the pentester to check if a device or exploit can be done on the target device/network before 
			    actually conducting the exploit.

 
	5) Description :- A brief description of the module, providing information about the Bluetooth vulnerability or exploit.
