                            MYSQL INJECTION.
                        =====================
            BASICS
        ---------------
- In sql the ' represents a string and the rest is the query.
- The query is executed when the string is not closed.
    EG.
        select * from users where username='admin' AND password='password'

            - the 'admin' and 'password' are strings.
