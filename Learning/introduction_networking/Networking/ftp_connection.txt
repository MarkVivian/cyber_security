				FIRST CONNECTIONS
they are used to pass files from machines on a network.
it uses the ports 21, 20.

to access the port you use the command:
	eg = ftp remote-ip-address -p 21

if you wish to use a more secure ftp:
	1) you can use SFTP which uses ssh.
		eg = sftp username@remote-ip-address

	2) you can use FTP secure:
		eg = ftp -s:ftp://username@public-ip-address


				MOVING DATA FROM REMOTE TO LOCAL PC.
we use the put and get commands.

PUT -> we use this when i want to put data from the host machine to the remote machine.
	eg = put /path/in/host/machine/file.txt file.txt

GET -> we use this when i want to retrieve data from the remote machine to the host machine.
	eg = GET file.txt file.txt 

LCD -> <local change directory> this is cd but for the host machine when you are connected to the remote machine. 
		this is because the cd will move directories only for the remote machine.

MGET/MPUT -> similar to get and put but for folders.

BYE -> exits the ftp connection.
