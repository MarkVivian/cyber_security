                                    NETWORK TOPOLOGIES.
                                =========================
- We can divide the entire network topology area into 3 areas:

           1) CONNECTIONS
        -----------------
Wired Connections.                                  Wireless connections.
Coaxial cabling.                                    wifi
Glass fibre cabling.                                Cellular.
Twisted-pair cabling.                               Satelite.
and others.                                         and others.



            2) NODES - NETWORK INTERFACE CONTROLLER (NICs)
        --------------------------------------------------
Repeaters                   Hubs                        Bridges             Switches.
Router/Modem                Gateways                    Firewalls.

- Network nodes are the transmission medium's connection points to transmitters and receivers of electrical, optical, or radio signals in the medium.
- A node may be connected to a computer, but certain types may have only one microcontroller on a node or may have no programmable device at all.



            3) CLASSIFICATIONS.
        --------------------------
- We can imagine a topology as a virtual form or structure of a network. 
- This form does not necessarily correspond to the actual physical arrangement of the devices in the network. 
- Therefore these topologies can be either physical or logical. 
- Eg., the computers on a LAN may be arranged in a circle in a bedroom, but it is very unlikely to have an actual ring topology.

Network topologies are divided into the following eight basic types:

point-to-point                              Bus.
Star                                        Ring.
Mesh                                        Tree.
Hybrid                                      Daisy Chain.


        POINT TO POINT.
    --------------------
- The simplest network topology with a dedicated connection between two hosts is the point-to-point topology.
- In this topology, a direct and straightforward physical link exists only between two hosts.
- These two devices can use these connections for mutual communication.

Point-to-point topologies are the basic model of traditional telephony and must not be confused with P2P (Peer-to-Peer architecture).

HOST A ------------------------------- HOST B.


        BUS.
    -----------
- All hosts are connected via a transmission medium in the bus topology.
- Every host has access to the transmission medium and the signals that are transmitted over it.
- There is no central network component that controls the processes on it.
- The transmission medium for this can be, for example, a coaxial cable.

- Since the medium is shared with all the others,
- only one host can send, and all the others can only receive and evaluate the data and see whether it is intended for itself.


          HOST A                   HOST C                      HOST E 
            |                         |                          |       
            |_________________________|__________________________|
            |                         |                          |
            HOST B                  HOST D                      HOST F


            STAR.
        ------------
- The star topology is a network component that maintains a connection to all hosts.
- Each host is connected to the central network component via a separate link. This is usually a router, a hub, or a switch.
- These handle the forwarding function for the data packets. To do this, the data packets are received and forwarded to the destination. 
- The data traffic on the central network component can be very high since all data and connections go through it.

                            HOST B.
                              |
                              |
                              |
        HOST A ------------ ROUTER -------------HOST C
                              |
                              |
                              |
                            HOST D.


            RING.
        ------------
- The physical ring topology is such that each host or node is connected to the ring with two cables:
    > One for the incoming signals and
    > the another for the outgoing ones.

- This means that one cable arrives at each host and one cable leaves.
- The ring topology typically does not require an active network component.
- The control and access to the transmission medium are regulated by a protocol to which all stations adhere.

- A logical ring topology is based on a physical star topology, where a distributor at the node simulates the ring by forwarding from one port to the next.

- The information is transmitted in a predetermined transmission direction. 
- Typically, the transmission medium is accessed sequentially from station to station using a retrieval system from the central station or a token.
- A token is a bit pattern that continually passes through a ring network in one direction, which works according to the claim token process.

                        |
                    HOST D            


            MESH.
        ------------
-  Many nodes decide about the connections on a physical level and the routing on a logical level in meshed networks.
- Therefore, meshed structures have no fixed topology.
- There are two basic structures from the basic concept: the fully meshed and the partially meshed structure.

- Each host is connected to every other host in the network in a fully meshed structure.
- This means that the hosts are meshed with each other.
- This technique is primarily used in WAN or MAN to ensure high reliability and bandwidth.

- In this setup, important network nodes such as routers could be networked together.
- If one router fails, the others can continue to work without problems, and the network can absorb the failure due to the many connections.

- Each node of a fully meshed topology has the same routing functions and knows the neighboring nodes it can communicate with proximity to the network gateway and traffic loads.

- In the partially meshed structure, the endpoints are connected by only one connection.
- In this type of network topology, specific nodes are connected to exactly one other node, and some other nodes are connected to two or more other nodes with a point-to-point connection.
                    
                        HOST B.

                          |
                ________ROUTER B.________
                |         |             |

                          |
                        ROUTER D.
                          |
                          |
                        HOST D.

 
            TREE.
        ------------
- The tree topology is an extended star topology that more extensive local networks have in this structure.
- This is especially useful when several topologies are combined.
- This topology is often used, for example, in larger company buildings.

- There are both logical tree structures according to the spanning tree and physical ones.
- Modular modern networks, based on structured cabling with a hub hierarchy, also have a tree structure.
- Tree topologies are also used for broadband networks and city networks (MAN).

            HYBRID.
        ------------
- Hybrid networks combine two or more topologies so that the resulting network does not present any standard topologies.
- For example, a tree network can represent a hybrid topology in which star networks are connected via interconnected bus networks.
- However, a tree network that is linked to another tree network is still topologically a tree network.
- A hybrid topology is always created when two different basic network topologies are interconnected.

        |-------ROUTER A--------------------ROUTER C.-------|
HOST B--|                                                   |--------HOST F.


            DAISY CHAIN.
        ------------------
- In the daisy chain topology, multiple hosts are connected by placing a cable from one node to another.

- Since this creates a chain of connections,
- it is also known as a daisy-chain configuration in which multiple hardware components are connected in a series.
- This type of networking is often found in automation technology (CAN).

- Daisy chaining is based on the physical arrangement of the nodes,
- in contrast to token procedures, which are structural but can be made independent of the physical layout.
- The signal is sent to and from a component via its previous nodes to the computer system.
