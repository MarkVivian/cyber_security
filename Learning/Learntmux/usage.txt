		Steps to Merge Two tmux Windows into One with Panes:
	--------------------------------------------------------------
- Switch to the target window (the one where you want to bring the second window in as a pane):
	EG.
		ctrl + b  1

			> (Replace 1 with the window number where you want to merge the other window.)

 
- Join the second window as a pane:
	EG.
		ctrl + b  :join-pane -s 2

			> (Replace 2 with the window number you want to move.)
