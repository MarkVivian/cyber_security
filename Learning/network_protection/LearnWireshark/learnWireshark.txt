NB:: MAKE SURE YOU RUN IT IN SUDO /ROOT USER MODE..


					USAGE..
				================
Wireshark is an open-source network protocol analyzer. 
It allows you to capture and interactively browse the traffic running on a computer network. 
It is widely used for network troubleshooting, analysis, software and protocol development, and education.


				WHAT CAN I DO
			=======================
filtering -> since wireshark receives packets to and from the network, we recieve soo many packets as they pass through the 
			network. so we can filter the specific network you wish like:
				tcp - for tcp connections.
				udp - for udp connections.
				ip.addr - for finding a specific ip address.
				tcp.port/udp.port - for finding specific ports called by a tcp or udp connection. 
				frame/tcp contains/matches "String" - search by a specific string.MAKE SURE YOU USE THE DOUBLE QUOTES.


Network Troubleshooting ->Identify network issues such as latency, packet loss, and congestion.
    					  Detect and analyze network misconfigurations.


Security Analysis: -> Monitor network traffic for suspicious activity or potential security breaches.
    				  Capture evidence of attacks like DDoS, Man-in-the-Middle, and unauthorized access.


Protocol Analysis: -> Examine the behavior of protocols and how they interact.
					  Debug protocol implementations.


Performance Monitoring -> Analyze network performance and optimize it.
    					  Measure bandwidth usage and identify bandwidth hogs.

Education -> Learn about network protocols and how they function.
    		 Study network behavior in real-time.
