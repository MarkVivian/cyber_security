                            # HEAP SORT ALGORITHM
'''
- Heap Sort is a comparison-based sorting algorithm that uses a binary heap data structure to sort elements.
- It works by first building a max heap from the input data, and then repeatedly extracting the maximum element from the heap and rebuilding the heap until all elements are sorted.
- Heap Sort is particularly efficient for large datasets and has a good worst-case performance.
