                                        WINDOWS FILE TRANSFER METHODS.
                                =========================================
- The Windows operating system has evolved over the past few years, and new versions come with different utilities for file transfer operations. 
- Understanding file transfer in Windows can help both attackers and defenders. 
- Attackers can use various file transfer methods to operate and avoid being caught. 
- Defenders can learn how these methods work to monitor and create the corresponding policies to avoid being compromised. 
- Let's use the Microsoft Astaroth Attack blog post as an example of an advanced persistent threat (APT).

- The blog post starts out talking about fileless threats. 
- The term fileless suggests that a threat doesn't come in a file, they use legitimate tools built into a system to execute an attack. 
- This doesn't mean that there's not a file transfer operation. 
- As discussed later in this section, the file is not "present" on the system but runs in memory.

- The Astaroth attack generally followed these steps: A malicious link in a spear-phishing email led to an LNK file. 
- When double-clicked, the LNK file caused the execution of the WMIC tool with the "/Format" parameter, which allowed the download and execution of malicious JavaScript code. 
- The JavaScript code, in turn, downloads payloads by abusing the Bitsadmin tool.

- All the payloads were base64-encoded and decoded using the Certutil tool resulting in a few DLL files. 
- The regsvr32 tool was then used to load one of the decoded DLLs, which decrypted and loaded other files until the final payload, Astaroth, was injected into the Userinit process. 
- Below is a graphical depiction of the attack.
