1. Repeater

    Purpose: Manually modify and re-send individual HTTP requests and analyze the responses.
    How it works:
        After capturing a request using Burp’s Proxy, you can send it to the Repeater tab.
        You can edit different parts of the request (URL, parameters, headers, etc.) and then resend it to see how the server responds.
    Use case:
        This is often used for testing input variations in fields like forms or headers, probing for vulnerabilities (like SQL injection, XSS), or seeing how the server responds to different crafted requests.

2. Collaborator

    Purpose: Used for detecting out-of-band vulnerabilities (e.g., blind SQL injection, blind XSS, SSRF).
    How it works:
        Burp Collaborator interacts with external services by providing an out-of-band (OOB) payload (e.g., a custom URL).
        If the server sends a DNS, HTTP, or SMTP request back to the Burp Collaborator service, it confirms the vulnerability.
    Use case:
        Used in scenarios where vulnerabilities aren’t visible immediately in the response but trigger some action on the server side (like sending requests to external servers).

3. Sequencer

    Purpose: Analyze the quality of randomness in session tokens, anti-CSRF tokens, and other data generated by the server.
    How it works:
        You feed Sequencer with a series of tokens (e.g., session IDs, anti-CSRF tokens), and it statistically analyzes them to determine how predictable they are.
    Use case:
        You use this to check whether the tokens used for maintaining sessions or protecting against CSRF attacks are truly random and secure or if they are predictable and exploitable.

4. Decoder

    Purpose: Encode and decode data in various formats (e.g., Base64, URL encoding, hex).
    How it works:
        Paste the encoded or obfuscated data into the Decoder and select the appropriate encoding/decoding method to see the plain text value or vice versa.
    Use case:
        This tool is used when you encounter obfuscated data (e.g., in URLs, cookies, JWT tokens), and you want to decode it to understand or manipulate it.
        It’s also useful for encoding payloads before injecting them into requests.

5. Comparer

    Purpose: Compare two sets of data to find differences.
    How it works:
        You send two requests or responses to Comparer and then analyze the differences side-by-side.
    Use case:
        This is particularly useful when comparing server responses to slightly different input values.
        For example, you can compare normal and error responses to look for small details that could reveal a vulnerability.

6. Logger

    Purpose: Keep a detailed log of HTTP/S requests and responses.
    How it works:
        It passively logs all HTTP traffic that passes through Burp Suite’s proxy, allowing you to revisit and analyze previous requests.
    Use case:
        You can use Logger to audit all traffic going through Burp, identify requests that were missed, or trace back steps in your testing. This can help with debugging or revisiting a previous test case.

7. Organizer

    Purpose: Manage and organize your engagement activities within Burp Suite.
    How it works:
        This allows you to group your tasks, notes, and findings into sections and manage your testing workflow.
    Use case:
        It's useful for large-scale penetration testing engagements where organization is critical to keeping track of multiple targets, different vulnerabilities, and phases of testing.

8. Extensions

    Purpose: Extend Burp Suite’s functionality using third-party add-ons and custom scripts.
    How it works:
        You can browse and install a wide variety of extensions from the Burp App Store or build your own using Burp’s API.
        Extensions allow you to add custom tools or enhance existing ones (e.g., additional scanning, fuzzing capabilities, custom data processors).
    Use case:
        The Extensions tab is especially useful for specialized tasks where Burp’s built-in features aren’t enough. For example, extensions like AuthMatrix help in testing authentication mechanisms, while SQLMapper adds SQL injection testing capabilities.
        You can also develop your own plugins if you need custom functionality for your tests.

Practical Usage Example:

    Repeater: After discovering a potential injection point, you would modify the request in Repeater to manually test different payloads and observe the response.
    Collaborator: When testing for blind vulnerabilities, you would craft a payload with a Burp Collaborator URL and see if the target server sends a request to the Collaborator server.
    Sequencer: To ensure that session cookies aren’t predictable, you feed the cookies into the Sequencer to see if the randomness is strong enough.
    Decoder: After capturing an encoded payload or session token, you would use the Decoder to convert it back to its original format.
    Comparer: If two slightly different requests return different responses, you can use Comparer to pinpoint exactly where the differences lie.
    Extensions: If Burp doesn’t already have a feature or tool for a specific task (e.g., specialized API testing), you can install or build extensions that add the required functionality.
