                                STATUS CODES.
                            =====================
1. 200 OK: 
    - The URL exists, and the server successfully returned content.
    - This indicates a valid file or directory.
        EG.
            CODE:200 [SIZE:92241]
            
                - The size 92241 indicates how large the page is. This can help you spot potentially sensitive or interesting files.


2. 301 Moved Permanently:
    - The URL has been moved to another location.
    - It usually means the URL is a redirect, and dirb will follow it.
        EG.
            CODE:301
        
                - You may want to check where it's being redirected.


3. 302 Found:
    - This is a temporary redirect, meaning the content is elsewhere temporarily.
        EG.
            CODE:302


4. 403 Forbidden:
    - The server understands the request, but you don't have permission to access it.
    - This might mean the file exists but is protected.
        EG.
            CODE:403


5. 404 Not Found:
    - The URL does not exist.
    - It indicates that dirb tried to access something that isn't there.
        EG.
            CODE:404


6. 500 Internal Server Error:
    - This indicates a problem on the server side, which could be due to a misconfiguration or other error.


7. 503 Service Unavailable:
    -  The server cannot handle the request at the moment, often due to being overloaded.
