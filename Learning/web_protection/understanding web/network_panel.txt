                        NETWORK PANEL
                    ====================
        3.1 Opening & Overview
    -------------------------------
- Open DevTools → Network tab.
- Reload the page (F5); you’ll see all requests the browser makes: HTML, CSS, JS, images, and form submissions.

ELI5: “Think of Network as your browser’s diary—it writes down every time it talks to the server.”


        3.2 Key Columns
    ----------------------------
| Column        | Meaning                                    |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| **Name**      | The resource or endpoint (e.g., `brute/`). |
| **Method**    | HTTP method: GET, POST, etc.               |
| **Status**    | Response code: 200 OK, 403 Forbidden, etc. |
| **Type**      | Resource type: document, script, xhr, img. |
| **Initiator** | What triggered the request (parser, JS).   |
| **Time**      | Total round‑trip time.                     |
| **Size**      | Response payload size.                     |


3.3 Filtering & Searching
Filter by type: Click “XHR” to see only AJAX/form requests.

Search by URL substring in the filter box.

Hide data URLs or preserve log (keep entries across navigations).

Example: In DVWA, filter “XHR” to isolate the login POST when you submit credentials.

3.4 Inspecting a Request
Click the row for your login request (e.g., brute/?username=…).

Two main sub‑panels appear:

Headers

General: URL, Request Method, Status Code, Remote Address.

Request Headers: User‑Agent, Cookie, Content‑Type, etc.

Response Headers: Server, Set‑Cookie, Content‑Length, etc.

Payload / Request Body (for POST)

Shows form fields (e.g., username=admin&password=1234).

Useful to see exactly what data the server receives.

Preview/Response

View raw or rendered response (HTML, JSON, etc.).

Example: Submit “admin”/“password” in DVWA brute page, click that POST entry → under Payload see:

ini
Copy
Edit
username=admin
password=password
Login=Login
3.5 Replay & Edit & Resend
Right‑click the request → Replay XHR (Firefox) or Resend (Chrome).

Edit the method, URL, headers, or body before sending again.

Use this to test different passwords without reloading the page.

Example: Change the password field to “letmein” inline, resend, and observe the response code/status.

3.6 Exporting & Importing
Export HAR (HTTP Archive) for offline analysis or sharing with teammates:

Right‑click → Save all as HAR.

Import HAR into other tools (e.g., Burp Suite, Fiddler).

3.7 Real‑World Pentest Use Cases
Timing attacks: Measure Time column to detect delays (e.g., slow SQL responses).

Cookie manipulation: Edit request headers to forge or remove cookies.

Session fixation: Replay login with fixed session ID to test session controls.

Checkpoint:

Can you see and identify the DVWA login POST request?

Were you able to inspect Headers and Payload?

Try replaying it with a modified password field.
