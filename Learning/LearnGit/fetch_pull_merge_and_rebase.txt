                        FETCH, PULL , MERGE AND REBASE.
                    ======================================
1. git fetch
    - git fetch` downloads new commits, branches, and refs from a remote repository but does NOT modify your current branch or working directory.
    - It updates remote tracking branches like:
        origin/main
        EG.
            git fetch

                * Contacts default remote (usually origin)
                * Downloads new objects
                * Updates remote tracking branches
                * Does NOT change your branch

            # Fetch Specific Remote
            git fetch origin

                * Same as above but explicitly targeting origin.

            # Fetch Specific Branch
            git fetch origin dev

                * Downloads commits for dev
                * Updates origin/dev
                * Your local dev branch does NOT move

            # Fetch All Remotes
            git fetch --all

                * Downloads updates from all configured remotes.
            
            # Prune Deleted Remote Branches
            git fetch --prune

                * Removes remote tracking branches that no longer exist on server.


2. git pull
    - git pull` = `git fetch` + `git merge`
    - It fetches remote updates and immediately integrates them into your current branch.
        EG.
            # Basic Pull
            git pull

                # Equivalent to:
                git fetch
                git merge origin/<current-branch>

            # Pull Specific Branch
            git pull origin dev

                * Fetches dev and merges it into your current branch.

            # Pull with Rebase Instead of Merge
            git pull --rebase

                # Equivalent to:
                git fetch
                git rebase origin/<current-branch>


3. git merge
    - Merge creates a new commit that combines two branch histories.
    - Unless it can fast-forward.
        EG.
            # Example Setup
            Imagine:

            A --- B --- C   (main)
                    \
                    D --- E   (feature)

                * You are on main.

            # Basic Merge
            git merge feature

                * Git finds common ancestor
                * Combines changes
                * Creates merge commit

            # Result:
            A --- B --- C -------- F   (main)
                    \          /
                    D --- E   (feature)

                * F is merge commit.


4. Fast-Forward Merge
    - If main has not moved:

        A --- B --- C   (main)
                    \
                    D --- E   (feature)

    - You run:
        EG.
            git merge feature

                * Git just moves main pointer forward:

            # Result:
            A --- B --- C --- D --- E   (main, feature)

                * No merge commit created.

            # Force Non Fast Forward
            git merge --no-ff feature

                * Forces merge commit even if fast-forward possible.


5. Merge Conflicts
    - Occurs when same lines changed in both branches.
    - Conflict markers:
        EG.
            <<<<<<< HEAD
            your changes
            =======
            incoming changes
            >>>>>>> feature

                * Resolve:
                    1. Edit file
                    2. Remove markers
                    3. Add file
                    4. Commit

            # Abort merge:
            git merge --abort


6.  git rebase
    - Rebase moves a sequence of commits to a new base commit.
    - It rewrites commit history by creating new commits.
        EG.
            # Before:
            A --- B --- C   (main)
                    \
                    D --- E   (feature)

            # On feature:
            git rebase main

            # After:
            A --- B --- C --- D' --- E'   (feature)

                * D' and E' are NEW commits.
                * Different hashes.
                * Old D and E still exist but become unreachable eventually.


7. Interactive Rebase
    EG.
        git rebase -i HEAD~3
            
            - Lets you:
                * Reorder commits
                * Squash commits
                * Edit commit messages
                * Drop commits

            - Options inside editor:
                * pick
                * reword
                * edit
                * squash
                * fixup
                * drop


8. Rebase Conflict Handling
    - If conflict occurs:
        * Resolve file.
    - Then:
        EG.
            git add file.txt
            git rebase --continue

    - Abort:
        EG.
            git rebase --abort


9. Force Push
    - After rebase:
        EG.
            git push --force

            # Better:
            git push --force-with-lease

                * Rebase rewrites history.
                * Remote branch has old commits.
                * Force push replaces remote history.


10. Merge vs Rebase Comparison
    | Merge                    | Rebase                       |
    | ------------------------ | ---------------------------- |
    | Preserves history        | Rewrites history             |
    | Creates merge commit     | Linear history               |
    | Safe for shared branches | Dangerous on shared branches |
    | Non-destructive          | Destructive if pushed        |
