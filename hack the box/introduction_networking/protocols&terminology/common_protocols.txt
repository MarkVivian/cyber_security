                            COMMON PROTOCOLS.
                        =======================
- Internet protocols are standardized rules and guidelines defined in RFCs that specify how devices on a network should communicate with each other.
- They ensure that devices on a network can exchange information consistently and reliably, regardless of the hardware and software used.
- For devices to communicate on a network, they need to be connected through a communication channel, such as a wired or wireless connection.
- The devices then exchange information using a set of standardized protocols that define the format and structure of the data being transmitted.
- The two main types of connections used on networks are 
    i) Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)
   ii) User Datagram Protocol (UDP).

- We need to deal with and know the different and most used protocols.
- As we have already learned, these protocols are the basis of all communication between our devices and computers in the networks.
- We have compiled below many of these protocols that we will be dealing with throughout the modules.
- The better we understand them, the more effectively we can work with them.


                TRANSMISSION CONTROL PROTOCOL.
            ------------------------------------
- TCP is a connection-oriented protocol that establishes a virtual connection between two devices before transmitting data by using a Three-Way-Handshake.
- This connection is maintained until the data transfer is complete, and the devices can continue to send data back and forth as long as the connection is active.
    EG.
        > When we enter a URL into our web browser, the browser sends an HTTP request to the server hosting the website using TCP. 
        > The server responds by sending the HTML code for the website back to the browser using TCP. 
        > The browser then uses this code to render the website on our screen. 
        > This process relies on a TCP connection being established between the browser and the web server and maintained until the data transfer is complete.
        > As a result, TCP is reliable but slower than UDP because it requires additional overhead for establishing and maintaining the connection.

        USER DATAGRAM PROTOCOL.
    ------------------------------------
- On the other hand, UDP is a connectionless protocol, which means it does not establish a virtual connection before transmitting data.
- Instead, it sends the data packets to the destination without checking to see if they were received.
    EG.
        > For example, when we stream or watch a video on a platform like YouTube, the video data is transmitted to our device using UDP.
        > This is because the video can tolerate some data loss, and the transmission speed is more important than the reliability.
        > If a few packets of video data are lost along the way, it will not significantly impact the overall quality of the video.
        > This makes UDP faster than TCP but less reliable because there is no guarantee that the packets will reach their destination.

Control Protocol

                ICMP.
            --------------
- Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) is a protocol used by devices to communicate with each other on the Internet for various purposes, including error reporting and status information.
- It sends requests and messages between devices, which can be used to report errors or provide status information.

        ICMP REQUESTS.
    ---------------------
- A request is a message sent by one device to another to request information or perform a specific action. 
- An example of a request in ICMP is the ping request, which tests the connectivity between two devices.
- When one device sends a ping request to another, the second device responds with a ping reply message.

        ICMP Messages
    -----------------------
- A message in ICMP can be either a request or a reply. 
-In addition to ping requests and responses, ICMP supports other types of messages, such as error messages, destination unreachable, and time exceeded messages.
- These messages are used to communicate various types of information and errors between devices on the network.
    EG.
        > For example, if a device tries to send a packet to another device and the packet cannot be delivered, the device can use ICMP to send an error message back to the sender.
        > ICMP has two different versions:

            = ICMPv4: For IPv4 only
            = ICMPv6: For IPv6 only

- ICMPv4 is the original version of ICMP, developed for use with IPv4.
- It is still widely used and is the most common version of ICMP.
- On the other hand, ICMPv6 was developed for IPv6. It includes additional functionality and is designed to address some of the limitations of ICMPv4.

Request Type 	        Description
Echo Request 	        This message tests whether a device is reachable on the network. When a device sends an 
                        echo request, it expects to receive an echo reply message. For example, the tools tracert (Windows) or traceroute (Linux) always send ICMP echo requests.

Timestamp Request 	    This message determines the time on a remote device.

Address Mask Request 	This message is used to request the subnet mask of a device.

Message Type 	        Description
Echo reply 	            This message is sent in response to an echo request message.

Destination             This message is sent when a device cannot deliver a packet to its destination.
unreachable

Redirect 	            A router sends this message to inform a device that it should send its 
                        packets to a different router.

time exceeded 	        This message is sent when a packet has taken too long to reach its destination.

Parameter problem 	    This message is sent when there is a problem with a packet's header.

Source quench 	        This message is sent when a device receives packets too quickly and cannot keep up.
                         It is used to slow down the flow of packets.


- Another crucial part of ICMP for us is the Time-To-Live (TTL) field in the ICMP packet header that limits the packet's lifetime as it travels through the network.
- It prevents packets from circulating indefinitely on the network in the event of routing loops.
- Each time a packet passes through a router, the router decrements the TTL value by 1.
- When the TTL value reaches 0, the router discards the packet and sends an ICMP Time Exceeded message back to the sender.

- We can also use TTL to determine the number of hops a packet has taken and the approximate distance to the destination. 
    EG.
        > if a packet has a TTL of 10 and takes 5 hops to reach its destination, it can be inferred that the destination is approximately 5 hops away.
        
            EG.
                - if we see a ping with the TTL value of 122, it could mean that we are dealing with a Windows system (TTL 128 by default) that is 6 hops away.


- However, it is also possible to guess the operating system based on the default TTL value used by the device.
- Each operating system typically has a default TTL value when sending packets.
- This value is set in the packet's header and is decremented by 1 each time the packet passes through a router.
- Therefore, examining a device's default TTL value makes it possible to infer which operating system the device is using.
    EG.
        > Windows systems (2000/XP/2003/Vista/10) typically have a default TTL value of 128, while macOS and Linux systems typically have a default TTL value of 64 and Solaris' default TTL value of 255.
        > However, it is important to note that the user can change these values, so they should be independent of a definitive way to determine a device's operating system.

        
        VoIP
    --------------
- Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) is a method of transmitting voice and multimedia communications.
    EG.
        > it allows us to make phone calls using a broadband internet connection instead of a traditional phone line, like Skype, Whatsapp, Google Hangouts, Slack, Zoom, and others.

- The most common VoIP ports are TCP/5060 and TCP/5061, which are used for the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP).
- However, the port TCP/1720 may also be used by some VoIP systems for the H.323 protocol, a set of standards for multimedia communication over packet-based networks.
- Still, SIP is more widely used than H.323 in VoIP systems.

- Nevertheless, SIP is a signaling protocol for initiating, maintaining, modifying, and terminating real-time sessions involving video, voice, messaging, and other communications applications and services between two or more endpoints on the Internet.
- Therefore, it uses requests and methods between the endpoints. The most common SIP requests and methods are:

Method 	        Description
INVITE 	        Initiates a session or invites another endpoint to participate.
ACK 	        Confirms the receipt of an INVITE request.
BYE 	        Terminate a session.
CANCEL 	        Cancels a pending INVITE request.
REGISTER 	    Registers a SIP user agent (UA) with a SIP server.
OPTIONS 	    Requests information about the capabilities of a SIP server or user agent, 
                such as the types of media it supports.


        INFORMATION DISCLOSER.
    ------------------------------
- However, SIP allows us to enumerate existing users for potential attacks. 
- This can be done for various purposes, such as determining a user's availability, finding out information about the user's capabilities or services, or performing brute-force attacks on user accounts later on.

- One of the possible ways to enumerate users is the SIP OPTIONS request.
- It is a method used to request information about the capabilities of a SIP server or user agents, such as the types of media it supports, the codecs it can decode, and other details.
- The OPTIONS request can probe a SIP server or user agent for information or test its connectivity and availability.

- During our analysis, it is possible to discover a SEPxxxx.cnf file, where xxxx is a unique identifier, is a configuration file used by Cisco Unified Communications Manager, formerly known as Cisco CallManager, to define the settings and parameters for a Cisco Unified IP Phone.
- The file specifies the phone model, firmware version, network settings, and other details.
