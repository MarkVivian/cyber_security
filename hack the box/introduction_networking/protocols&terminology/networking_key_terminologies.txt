                            NETWORK KEY TERMINOLOGY.
                        ==============================
- There are many different terms in the field of information technology. However, we only need to know some of them, only the essential ones.
- Information technology has become so big that it equals the medical sector, if not already surpasses it.
- The number of programming languages, functions, protocols, different procedures, areas of application, details, and at the same time, the number of errors that can occur.
- All these areas are so large that you can specialize your entire career in 1-2 areas.

- The key terminology is the rough alphabet we need to know to understand what we will talk about in the other modules.
- We have created a list with many different but still with the most common protocols and their descriptions to create this foundation.
- It is important to note that this list is incomplete, and we will cover one or two protocols in other modules.
- However, we recommend that you review this list from time to time and expand it as you learn new protocols.
