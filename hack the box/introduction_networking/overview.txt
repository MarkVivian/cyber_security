                                OVERVIEW.
                            ===============
-  Setting up a large, flat network is not extremely difficult, and it can be a reliable network, at least operationally. 
- However, a flat network is like building a house on a land plot and considering it secure because it has a lock on the door. 
- By creating lots of smaller networks and having them communicate, we can add defense layers. 
- Pivoting around a network is not difficult, but doing it quickly and silently is tough and will slow attackers down. 
- Back to the house scenario, let's walk through the following examples:

1) Example No.1
    - Building smaller networks and putting Access Control Lists around them is like putting a fence around the property's border.
    - that creates specific entry and exit points. 
    - an attacker could jump over the fence, but this looks suspicious and is not common, allowing it to be quickly detected as malicious.
    -  Why is the printer network talking to the servers over HTTP?


2) Example No.2
    - Taking the time to map out and document each network's purpose is like placing lights around the property, making sure all activity can be seen.
    - Why is the printer network talking to the internet at all?


3) Example No.3
    - Having bushes around windows is a deterrent to people attempting to open the window. 
    - Just like Intrusion Detection Systems like Suricata or Snort are a deterrent to running network scans. 
    - Why did a port scan originate from the printer network?


- if the printer is on a "flat /24 network" and gets a DHCP address, it can be challenging to place these types of restrictions on them.


                                STORY TIME : A PENTESTERS OVERSIGHT.
                            -------------------------------------------
- Most networks use a /24 subnet, so much so that many Penetration Testers will set this subnet mask (255.255.255.0) without checking. 
- The /24 network allows computers to talk to each other as long as the first three octets of an IP Address are the same (ex: 192.168.1.xxx). 
- Setting the subnet mask to /25 divides this range in half, and the computer will be able to talk to only the computers on "its half." 
- We have seen Penetration Test reports where the assessor claimed a Domain Controller was offline when it was just on a different network in reality.
- The network structure was something like this:

    Server Gateway: 10.20.0.1/25
    Domain Controller: 10.20.0.10/25
    Client Gateway: 10.20.0.129/25
    Client Workstation: 10.20.0.200/25
    Pentester IP: 10.20.0.252/24 (Set Gateway to 10.20.0.1)

- The Pentester communicated with the Client Workstations and thought they did an excellent job because they managed to steal a workstation password via Impacket.
- However, due to a failure to understand the network, they never managed to get off the Client Network and reach more "high value" targets such as database servers. 
- Hopefully, if this sounds confusing to you, you can come back to this statement at the end of the module and understand it!

- As with sending mail or packets, we know the address where the packets should go. 
- The website address or Uniform Resource Locator (URL) which we enter into our browser is also known as Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN).

- The difference between URL and FQDNs is :
    > A FQDN (www.hackthebox.com) only specifies the address of the building.
    > A URL (https://www.hackthebox.com/example?floor=2&office=dev&employee=17) also specifies the floor, office, mailbox and corresponding employee.


- The fact is that we know the address, but not the exact geographical location of the address.
- In this situation, the post office can determine the exact location, which then forwards the packets to the desired location.
- Therefore, our post office forwards our packets to the main post office, representing our Internet Service Provider (ISP).

- Our post office is our router which we utilize to connect to the "Internet" in networking.

- As soon as we send our packet through our post office (router), the packet is forwarded to the main post office (ISP).
- This main post office looks in the address register (Domain Name Service) for this address location and returns the geographical coordinates (IP address). 
- Now that we know the address's exact location, our packet is sent directly there by a direct flight via our main post office.

- After the web server has received our packet with the request of what their website looks like, 
    > the webserver sends us back the packet with the data for the presentation of the website via the post office (router) of the "Company Network"
    > to the specified return address (our IP address).
