                                =========================
    Resetting BIOS Password and Settings
    ---------------------------------------
                    Difference Between CLR_CMOS and PASS/PSWD Jumpers
                    ---------------------------------------------------
> CLR_CMOS: Used to reset all BIOS settings to their defaults, including passwords.
> PASS/PSWD: Specifically used to reset or bypass the BIOS password without affecting other BIOS settings.

    Steps to Reset Using Jumpers
------------------------------------
                Using CLR_CMOS Jumper   
            -----------------------------
> Power Off: Turn off your computer and unplug it from the power source.
> Locate CLR_CMOS Jumper: Find the jumper labeled "CLR_CMOS" on your motherboard.
> Move the Jumper:
    > Three-pin Jumper: Move the jumper from the default position (usually pins 1 and 2) to the reset position (pins 2 and 3).
    > Two-pin Jumper: Place a jumper cap on both pins to short them.

> Wait: Leave the jumper in the reset position for about 10 seconds.
> Restore Jumper: Move the jumper back to the default position.
> Power On: Plug in the computer and turn it on. The BIOS settings, including the password, should be reset to default.

                Using PASS/PSWD Jumper
            -------------------------------
    Power Off: Turn off your computer and unplug it from the power source.
    Locate PASS/PSWD Jumper: Find the jumper labeled "PASS" or "PSWD" on your motherboard.
    Move the Jumper:
        Three-pin Jumper: Move the jumper from the default position (usually pins 1 and 2) to the reset position (pins 2 and 3).
        Two-pin Jumper: Place a jumper cap on both pins to short them.
    Wait: Leave the jumper in the reset position for about 10 seconds.
    Restore Jumper: Move the jumper back to the default position.
    Power On: Plug in the computer and turn it on. The BIOS password should be reset or bypassed, but other BIOS settings will remain unchanged.

Using a Dedicated CMOS Reset Button

    Power Off: Turn off your computer and unplug it from the power source.
    Locate the Button: Find the button labeled "CMOS," "CLR_CMOS," or similar.
    Press and Hold: Press and hold the button for 5-10 seconds.
    Release and Wait: Release the button and wait a few seconds.
    Power On: Plug in the computer and turn it on. The BIOS should be reset to default settings, including any passwords.

Removing the CMOS Battery

    Power Off: Turn off your computer and unplug it from the power source.
    Locate the CMOS Battery: Find the CMOS battery on your motherboard (a small, round, silver battery).
    Remove the Battery: Gently remove the battery from its socket.
    Wait: Leave the battery out for about 5-10 minutes to ensure the CMOS memory is cleared.
    Reinsert the Battery: Put the battery back into its socket.
    Power On: Plug in the computer and turn it on. The BIOS settings, including the password, should be reset to default.
