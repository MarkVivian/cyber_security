                            LABELS AND GOTO STATEMENTS.
                        =====================================
Labels (`:label`)
--------------------------------
- Labels are used to mark positions in the script where execution can jump to using the goto statement.
- A label is defined by starting a line with a colon followed by the label name, like :loop.
    EG.
        @echo off
        set /a count=0

        :loop
        echo Count is %count%
        set /a count+=1
        if %count% LSS 5 goto loop

        echo Loop has ended.
        pause

            :loop - marks theh beginning of a loop.
            goto loop - sends execution back to the :loop label.
