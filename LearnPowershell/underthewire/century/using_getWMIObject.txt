    EG.
        Get-WmiObject Win32_Process

            - This command retrieves information about all running processes using the Win32_Process WMI class.

    - You need to know the specific WMI class that represents the data you want to access. 
    - Common classes include:
        > Win32_Process: Information about running processes
        > Win32_Service: Details about Windows services
        > Win32_LogicalDisk: Properties of physical and logical disks
        > Win32_ComputerSystem: General information about the computer system
        > Win32_UserAccount: User account details

    EG.
        Get-WmiObject -Class Win32_Process
