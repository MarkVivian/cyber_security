                        SET EXECUTION POLICY
                    ==========================
- execution policies determine the conditions under which PowerShell loads configuration files and runs scripts. 
- Execution policies help prevent the execution of malicious scripts.


            TYPES OF EXECUTION POLICIES.
        -----------------------------------
- Restricted:
    > Does not load configuration files or run scripts. This is the default setting on Windows client computers.

- AllSigned:
    > Requires that all scripts and configuration files be signed by a trusted publisher, including scripts written on the local computer.
 
- RemoteSigned:
    > Requires that all scripts and configuration files downloaded from the Internet be signed by a trusted publisher.

- Unrestricted: 
    > Loads all configuration files and runs all scripts. 
    > If you run an unsigned script that was downloaded from the Internet, you are prompted for permission before it runs.

- Bypass:
    > Nothing is blocked and there are no warnings or prompts.

- Undefined:
    > Removes the currently assigned execution policy from the current scope. 
    > If the execution policy in all scopes is set to Undefined, the effective execution policy is Restricted.


                SETTING EXECUTION POLICY.
            -------------------------------
1) Setting execution policy to RemoteSigned
    EG.
        Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned


2) Checking execution Policy.
    EG.
        Get-ExecutionPolicy


3) get the execution policy for all scopes.
    EG.
        Get-ExecutionPolicy -List

            > The Scopes include:
                - MachinePolicy:
                    - Set by a Group Policy for all users of the computer.
                
                - UserPolicy:
                    - Set by a Group Policy for the current user of the computer.
                
                - Process:
                    - Affects only the current PowerShell session.
                
                - CurrentUser:
                    - Affects only the current user.
                
                - LocalMachine:
                    - Affects all users on the current computer.


4) Change the execution policy temporarily.
    EG.
        Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process


5) Running a script with a specific execution policy.
    EG.
        Start-Process powershell.exe -ArgumentList "-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -FilePath C:\path\to\your\script.ps1" -Verb RunAs
