                ERROR ACTION
            ===================
- a common parameter available for most cmdlets in PowerShell. 
- It controls how the cmdlet responds to errors that might occur during its execution.


- Here are some common settings for ErrorAction:
    > Stop (Default): 
        - This is the default behavior. 
        - If an error is encountered, the cmdlet stops execution and throws an error terminating the script.


    Continue: 
        - The cmdlet continues execution even if errors occur. 
        - The errors are written to the $Error automatic variable but don't stop the script.
    
    
    SilentlyContinue: 
        - Similar to Continue, but errors aren't written to the $Error variable either.
    
    
    WriteError: 
        - Errors are written to the $Error variable and the error stream, but execution continues.
    
    
    Suspend: 
        - The cmdlet pauses execution and prompts the user for further action.

        EG.
            Get-Service -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue  # Silently ignore errors during service retrieval
