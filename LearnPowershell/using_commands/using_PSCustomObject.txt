                                                        PS CUSTOM OBJECT.
                                                ===========================
- It creates a structured object with named properties.
- You get full control over:
    > The property names
    > Their values
    > Their order (unlike New-Object)
    > And the object is treated as a "real" object, not a hashtable or string blob


                SYNTAX.
            ----------------
EG.
    [PSCustomObject]@{
        PropertyName1 = <value or expression>
        PropertyName2 = <value or expression>
    }

        - You must use @{} -> the hashtable syntax.
        - But with [PSCustomObject] in front, you're saying:
            > "Convert this hashtable into a full blown custom object."


                USAGE.
            --------------
1. Creating a structured log entry.
    EG.
        $log = [PSCustomObject]@{
            User = "Admin"
            Action = "Login"
            Timestamp = (Get-Date)
        }


2. Returning structure output from a function.
    EG.
        function Get-Snapshot {
            return [PSCustomObject]@{
                Time = (Get-Date)
                FreeSpace = (Get-PSDrive C).Free / 1GB
            }
        }


3. Building reports.
    EG.
        $results = @()

        foreach ($file in Get-ChildItem -File) {
            $results += [PSCustomObject]@{
                Name = $file.Name
                SizeKB = [math]::Round($file.Length / 1KB, 2)
            }
        }

        $results | Export-Csv -NoTypeInformation -Path "Report.csv"


4. You can pipe it.
    EG.
        $custom = [PSCustomObject]@{
            A = 1
            B = 2
        }

        $custom | Select-Object A


5. Nested [PSCustomObject]
    EG.
        [PSCustomObject]@{
            Name = "Test"
            Details = [PSCustomObject]@{
                OS = "Windows"
                RAM = "8GB"
            }
        }

Hashtable @{}:
    > Works for quick lookups
    > Like a dictionary/map
    > Bad for exporting, piping, filtering, sorting

[PSCustomObject]@{}:
    > Creates a real, typed object
    > Perfect for scripts, exports, data reporting
    > Used in 95% of real-world automation and tools
