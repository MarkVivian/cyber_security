                            RESOLVE PATH.
                        ====================
- Resolve-Path is used to convert a path with wildcards or relative paths into an absolute, fully qualified path. 


            SYNTAX
        ============
EG.
    Resolve-Path [-Path] <String[]> [-Relative] [-Credential <PSCredential>] [-UseTransaction] [<CommonParameters>]


            BASIC USES.
        ====================
1. Resolving a Relative Path to an Absolute Path
    EG.
        # Resolves the current directory (.) to its absolute path
        Resolve-Path -Path "."

            OUTPUT.
                Path
                ----
                C:\Users\YourUsername\CurrentDirectory



2. Resolving a path with wildcards.
    EG.
        # Resolves the wildcard path to absolute paths of matching items
        Resolve-Path -Path "C:\Windows\System32\*.exe"

            OUTPUT.
                Path
                ----
                C:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe
                C:\Windows\System32\notepad.exe
                ...


3. Resolving a Path to a File or Directory
    EG.
        # Resolves a path to a specific file or directory
        Resolve-Path -Path "C:\Program Files"

            OUTPUT.
                Path
                ----
                C:\Program Files


4.  Using -Relative Parameter
    - If you want to get the relative path from a certain directory, you can use the -Relative parameter.
        EG.
            # Resolves the path relative to the current directory
            Resolve-Path -Path "C:\Windows\System32\notepad.exe" -Relative

                OUTPUT.
                    ..\..\Windows\System32\notepad.exe


5. Resolving Multiple Paths
    - You can resolve multiple paths in one command by passing an array of paths.
        EG.
            # Resolves multiple paths in one go
            Resolve-Path -Path "C:\Windows\*", "C:\Program Files\*"


6. Resolving Symbolic Links
    - Resolve-Path will resolve the actual target of symbolic links or junctions.
        EG.
            # Resolves the target of a symbolic link or junction
            Resolve-Path -Path "C:\SymlinkFolder"


7. Using with Environment Variables
    - Resolve-Path can resolve paths with environment variables.
        EG.
            # Resolves a path with an environment variable
            Resolve-Path -Path "$env:ProgramFiles\*"
