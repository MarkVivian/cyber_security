                                            WHAT DOES PASS THRU DO.
                                        =============================
- The -PassThru parameter is used in many PowerShell commands that make changes or perform side-effects, but don’t return any output by default.
- It tells the command:
    > “After you’re done doing your job, give me the objects back too.”

        EG. (Compare-Object)
            Compare-Object $list1 $list2 -PassThru

                > without -PassThru 
                    * You get a nice table with <= and =>.
                    
                > With -PassThru
                    * You get the actual values (objects) that were different.

        - Great for piping those results forward or saving them.


        EG. (Remove-item)
            Remove-Item "test.txt" -PassThru

                > Normally this deletes the file silently.
                > With -PassThru, it returns the file object that was just deleted.
