                                START SLEEP.
                            ====================
- Is a powershell cmdlet that pauses the execution of a script for a specified period of time.


                SYNTAX.
            -----------------
EG.
    Start-Sleep [-Seconds] <Double>
    Start-Sleep [-Milliseconds] <Int32>


                PARAMETERS.
            ------------------
> -seconds: 
    - Specifies the number of seconds to pause the script.

> -Milliseconds:
    - Specifies the number of milliseconds to pause the script


                    EXAMPLES.
                -----------------
1) Pausing for a Few Seconds
    - Pause the script for 5 seconds:
        EG.
            Start-Sleep -Seconds 5


2) Pausing for a Fraction of a Second
    - Pause the script for 500 milliseconds (0.5 seconds):
        EG.
            Start-Sleep -Milliseconds 500


3) Using in a Loop
    - Introduce a delay between iterations of a loop:
        EG.
            for ($i = 1; $i -le 5; $i++) {
                Write-Output "Iteration $i"
                Start-Sleep -Seconds 2
            }

                - This will output the iteration number and pause for 2 seconds between each iteration.
                - Combining with Other Cmdlets


4) Use Start-Sleep to wait before performing another action, such as checking for a process:
    EG.
        while (-not (Get-Process -Name notepad -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue)) {
            Write-Output "Waiting for Notepad to start..."
            Start-Sleep -Seconds 5
        }
        Write-Output "Notepad is running!"

            - This script checks if Notepad is running every 5 seconds and outputs a message when it starts.
