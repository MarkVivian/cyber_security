                            JOIN PATH.
                        =================
- The `Join-Path` cmdlet is used to combine muutiple path segments into a single path.
- Specifically designed for working with file system paths.
- It combines path segments into a single path, ensuring proper handling of path separators.


        COMMON USES.
    -------------------
1) Combine two or more path segments.
    EG.
        $parentDirectory = "C:\Users\Mark\Desktop\Scripts\powershell"
        $fileName = "example.ps1"
        $fullPath = Join-Path -Path $parentDirectory -ChildPath $fileName
        Write-Host "Full Path: $fullPath"


2) Combine Multiple paths.
    EG.
        $root = "C:\Users"
        $user = "Mark"
        $subDirectory = "Desktop\Scripts\powershell"
        $fileName = "example.ps1"
        $fullPath = Join-Path -Path (Join-Path -Path (Join-Path -Path $root -ChildPath $user) -ChildPath $subDirectory) -ChildPath $fileName
        Write-Host "Full Path: $fullPath"


3) Resolves the resulting path to a fully qualified path.
    EG. 
        $user = "C:\Users\Mark"
        $directory = "Desktop\Scripts\powershell"
        $finalPath = Join-Path -Path $user -ChildPath $directory -Resolve
        Write-Host "Resolved Path: $finalPath"


4) Used when the path contains characters that are interpreted as wildcard characters.
    EG.
        $user = "C:\Users\Mark"
        $directory = "Desktop\Scripts\powershell"
        $finalPath = Join-Path -Path $user -ChildPath $directory -LiteralPath
        Write-Host "Literal Path: $finalPath"
