                        SORT OBJECT
                    =================
- Sorts objects by one or more of their properties.
- Ascending and case-insensitive by default. You can flip it, compound it, or even shuffle it (sort of).


            BASIC SYNTAX.
        --------------------
EG.
    Sort-Object [-Property] <string[]> [-Descending] [-Unique] [-Culture <string>] [-CaseSensitive]

        > it works on:
            Strings
            Numbers
            Dates
            Booleans
            ScriptBlock expression (advanced)


            USAGE.
        -------------
1. Sorting Process List Alphabetically by Name.
    EG.
        Get-Process | Sort-Object RAM

            - By default, sorts ascending - smallest first.
            - Case-insensitive by default.

            - Sort Descending by CPU 
                EG.
                    Get-Process | Sort-Object CPU -Descending 


2. Sort by multiple properties.
    EG.
        Get-ChildItem | Sort-Object Extension, Name

            - First it sorts by Extension, then within that group by Name.


3. Sort Unique Values.
    EG.
        Get-Process | Sort-Object Name -Unique 

            - Removes duplicates after sorting (first match wins)


4. Sort files by last modified date.
    EG.
        Get-ChildItem C:\Logs | Sort-Object LastWriteTime -Descending


5. Get Top 5 Largest Files (by size)
    EG.
        Get-ChildItem -Path C:\Windows -Recurse -File -ErrorAction SilentContinue | Sort-Object Length -Descending | Select-Object Name, Length -First 5


6. Sort based on specific column (Space\Tab Delimited)
    EG.
       Get-childItem -File | 
        Sort-Object Name -Descending | 
        Select-Object -First 20 Name, @{Name="first_letter"; Expression={($_ -split '')[1]}} | 
        Sort-Object first_letter


7. ignore case sensetivity.
    EG.
        Get-ChildItem $path | Sort-Object Name -CaseSensitive

            - it will sort the capitalized letters first then the smaller case words last.


8. Locale/Culture sensitivity in Sort-Object (-Culture)
    - The -Culture parameter affects how strings are sorted, especially when letters with accents or special characteres are involved (e.g., é, ü, ß, etc.)
        EG. 
            $data = "zebra", "äpfel", "apfel", "Öl", "ohr"

            # German culture
            $data | Sort-Object -Culture "de-DE"

            # Swedish culture
            $data | Sort-Object -Culture "sv-SE"

                - Output varies depending on how each culture treats umlauts and letter combinations.
                - Why this matters.
                    > "ä" in German is treated like "ae" and sorted after a
                    > In Swedish, "ä" is its own letter, sorted after z

                - if your sorting usernames, filenames, or display names in an international app/script, this absolutely matters.
                - You can check your current culture with:
                    EG.
                        Get-Culture.
