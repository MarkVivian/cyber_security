Start-Process: 
    - Starts one or more processes on the local computer.

-FilePath:  
    - Specifies the path to the executable file or script file that starts the process.

    - Specifies the parameters or arguments to use when starting the process.

-WorkingDirectory:
    - Specifies the location of the executable file.

-Verb:
    - Specifies a verb to use when starting the process.

            COMMON USES.
        --------------------
1) Starting an application.
    - This example starts Notepad.
        EG.
            Start-Process notepad.exe


2) Running a script with arguments.
    - This example runs a powershell script with arguments.
        EG.
            $scriptPath = "C:\Path\To\YourScript.ps1"
            $arguments = "-param1 value1 -param2 value2"

            Start-Process powershell.exe -ArgumentList "-File $scriptPath $arguments"


3) Opening a file with default application.
    - This example opens a PDF file with the default PDF viewer.
        EG. 
            $filePath = "C:\Path\To\YourDocument.pdf"

            Start-Process $filePath


4)Running a process As Administrator.
    - This example starts powershell as an administrator.
        EG.
            Start-Process powershell.exe -Verb RunAs


5) Run a script as admin.
    EG.
        # Path to the script to run
        $scriptPath = "C:\Path\To\YourScript.ps1"

        # Arguments to pass to the script
        $scriptArguments = "-param1 value1 -param2 value2"

        # Desired execution policy
        $executionPolicy = "Unrestricted"

        # Start a new PowerShell process with elevated permissions
        Start-Process powershell.exe -Verb RunAs `
            -ArgumentList "-NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy $executionPolicy -File `"$scriptPath`" $scriptArguments"

                 - The `"$scriptPath`" allows the script to be executed even with spaces in the path name. (usage of `"`").
                 - If you have used double quotes use single quotes with the `.

            > Start-Process powershell.exe -Verb RunAs:
                - Starts PowerShell with elevated permissions.
            
            > ArgumentList:
                - Passes the arguments to the new PowerShell process.

                > NoProfile: 
                    - Prevents loading the user's PowerShell profile, which can help avoid conflicts or unwanted scripts running.
                
                > ExecutionPolicy $executionPolicy:
                    - Sets the execution policy for the session.
                
                > File "$scriptPath":
                    - Specifies the script file to run.
                    - The backticks and double quotes around $scriptPath are necessary to handle paths with spaces.
                
                > $scriptArguments:
                    - Includes any additional arguments needed for the script.

            > Backticks (`):
                - Used for escaping characters in PowerShell.
                - In this example, they are used to handle the quotes around the script path.
            
            > Double Quotes ("):
                - Necessary to encapsulate the script path in case it contains spaces.
            
            > NoProfile:
                - Optional, but useful to avoid loading the userâ€™s profile, making the script run in a cleaner environment.
            
            > ExecutionPolicy $executionPolicy:
                - Ensures that the script runs under the specified execution policy.


6. Run a command.

    > Run command and wait for command to complete before continuing.
        EG.
            start-process Powershell -ArgumentList "-Command ""Write-Host 'hello world'""" -Wait
            
                - -Wait: Makes the script wait until the PowerShell process completes.

    > Run command and stop powershell from closing after the command has completed
        EG.
            start-process powershell -ArgumentList "-NoExit",  "-Command ""Write-Host 'hello world'""" -Wait

                -NoExit: Prevents the new PowerShell window from closing after running the command. 
                - We must use 2 double quotes for the command as in before Write-Host so that the commadn is taken as is.

    > Run multiple commands.
        EG.
            $cscript_command="cscript.exe `'$vbs_script`' /sethst:kms.03k.org"
            $cscript_activation="cscript.exe `'$vbs_script`' /act"

            Start-Process Powershell -Verb RunAs -ArgumentList "-Command $cscript_command; $cscript_activation" -Verbose -Wait
