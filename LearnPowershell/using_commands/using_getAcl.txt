                               
                               GET ACL.
                            ==============
- Get-Acl is a PowerShell cmdlet used to retrieve Access Control Lists (ACLs) for a specified resource like files, directories, or registry keys.
- ACLs determine the permissions that users and groups have on an object.


            BASIC USAGE.
        ==================
1. Syntax.
    EG.
        Get-Acl -Path "C:\MyFolder"

        > Path: The resource for which the ACL is retrieved.
        > Owner: The owner of the resource.
        > Group: The primary group associated with the resource.
        > Access: List of access rules for users and groups, including permissions like read, write, and execute.


2. Getting ACL of a File
    EG
        Get-Acl -Path "C:\MyFile.txt"

        - This command shows the ACL for the file C:\MyFile.txt, including the owner, group, and permissions.


3. Retrieving ACL for the Registry
    EG.
        Get-Acl -Path "HKLM:\Software\Microsoft\Windows"

        - This command retrieves the ACL for the Windows registry key under HKLM.


4. Accessing Specific Properties
    > List all access entries.
        EG.
            (Get-Acl -Path "C:\MyFile.txt").Access

            - This shows all the access entries (permissions) for C:\MyFile.txt.

    > Get Owner Information:
        EG.
            (Get-Acl -Path "C:\MyFile.txt").Owner

            - This retrieves the owner of the file.


5. Modifying ACL with Set-Acl
    - Set-Acl can modify the ACL for a resource.
        EG.
            # Changing Ownership
            $acl = Get-Acl "C:\MyFile.txt"
            $acl.SetOwner([System.Security.Principal.NTAccount]"NewOwner")
            Set-Acl -Path "C:\MyFile.txt" -AclObject $acl

            - This changes the owner of C:\MyFile.txt to NewOwner.


6. Retrieve Current ACL:
    EG.
        $acl = Get-Acl "C:\MyFile.txt"


7. Create a New Access Rule:
    EG.
        $newRule = New-Object System.Security.AccessControl.FileSystemAccessRule(
                    "DOMAIN\User",
                    "Read",
                    "Allow")


8. Add the New Rule:
    EG.
        $acl.AddAccessRule($newRule)


9. Apply the New ACL:
    EG.
        Set-Acl -Path "C:\MyFile.txt" -AclObject $acl
