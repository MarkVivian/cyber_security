                    WHERE OBJECT
                ===================
-  cmdlet is a fundamental tool for filtering objects based on specific criteria in PowerShell. 
- Its syntax might seem complex at first glance, but it offers great flexibility for various filtering needs.


- In most situations when we are using attributes like Name, Length etc we get them using:
    EG.
        <process name> | Get-Member
            EG.
                Get-ChildItem .\Documents\ | Get-Member

                
1) Filter processes by name
    EG.
        Get-Process | Where-Object {$_.Name -eq "notepad"}

            - This filters running processes and displays only those named "notepad" (case-insensitive).
            - The name should be exact for it to work.


2) Filter with wildcards characters.
    EG.
        Get-childItem .\Documents\ | where-object {$_.Name -Like "Wifi*"}

            - Will get any file that has Wifi in it.

            - For the inverse we do.
                EG.
                    Get-childItem .\Documents\ | where-object {$_.Name -NotLike "Wifi*"}


3) Filter files by size.
    EG.
        Get-ChildItem "C:\*.txt" | Where-Object {$_.Length -gt 1024}

            - This filters text files in the C:\ directory and displays only those with a size greater than 1024 bytes.


4) selecting object after filter.
    EG.
       Get-childItem .\Documents\ | where-object {$_.Name -Like "Wifi*"} | select-object Name 

            - selects the name atribute from the filtered selection.
