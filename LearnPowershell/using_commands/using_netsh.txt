                                            NETSH.
                                        ==============
- netsh (Network Shell) is a command-line utility in Windows used for network configuration and troubleshooting.
- It allows you to view and modify the network configuration of your machine, manage wireless profiles, configure firewalls, and perform network diagnostics.


                    BASIC SYNTAX.
                --------------------
EG.
    netsh <context> <command> <parameters>

        Context: The area of networking (e.g., interface, wlan, firewall, etc.).
        Command: The action you want to perform (e.g., show, add, delete, etc.).
        Parameters: The specific details of the action.

        - You can enter the netsh interactive shell by typing:
            EG.
                netsh

                    - From there, you can navigate contexts interactively. To exit, type exit.


                COMMON CONTEXTS.
            ---------------------
1. Interface context.
    - Used for managing network adapters.
        EG: View all network interfaces:
            netsh interface show interface

        EG: Enable or disable a network interface:
            netsh interface set interface "Wi-Fi" admin=enabled
            netsh interface set interface "Wi-Fi" admin=disabled


2. WLAN (Wireless LAN) Context
    - Used for managing wireless networks.
        EG:  List all saved Wi-Fi profiles:
            netsh wlan show profiles

        EG: View the details of a specific Wi-Fi profile:
            netsh wlan show profile name="ProfileName" key=clear

        EG: Connect to a Wi-Fi network
            netsh wlan connect name="ProfileName"

                - If the profile does not exist, you may need to first create it manually or import it.
                - also ensure that you can see the network / network is discoverable.
                    EG.
                        netsh wlan show networks

        EG: Disconnect from a Wi-Fi network:
            netsh wlan disconnect


3. IP Address Management
    - Used for setting static or dynamic IP configurations.
        EG:  Assign a static IP address:
            netsh interface ip set address name="Ethernet" static 192.168.1.100 255.255.255.0 192.168.1.1

        EG: Set an interface to use DHCP:
            netsh interface ip set address name="Ethernet" dhcp


4. Firewall Configuration   
    - Manage firewall rules and settings.
        EG: Enable or disable the Windows Firewall:
            netsh advfirewall set allprofiles state on
            netsh advfirewall set allprofiles state off

        EG: Add a firewall rule:
            netsh advfirewall firewall add rule name="Allow Ping" protocol=ICMPv4 dir=in action=allow

        EG: Delete a firewall rule:
            netsh advfirewall firewall delete rule name="Allow Ping"


5. Monitor Open Ports
    - List all listening ports to check for unusual or vulnerable services:
        EG.
            netsh interface ipv4 show tcpconnections


6. Capturing Network Traffic
    - Enabling and configuring network packet capturing:
        EG.
            netsh trace start capture=yes
            netsh trace stop
                
                - Captured data can be analyzed with tools like Wireshark.


7. Managing Vulnerable Services
    - Check for and disable older protocols like SMBv1:
        EG.
            netsh advfirewall firewall add rule name="Block SMBv1" dir=out action=block protocol=tcp localport=445


8. Auditing Wi-Fi Security
    - List all Wi-Fi profiles and ensure they use WPA2/WPA3:
        EG.
            netsh wlan show profiles name="ProfileName" key=clear   


9. Delete a Saved Profile   
    EG: Delete a saved Wi-Fi profile:
        netsh wlan delete profile name="WiFi_Name"

    EG: To delete all saved profiles:
        netsh wlan delete profile name=*


10. Setting Up a Wi-Fi Hotspot
    - netsh can be used to turn your Windows machine into a wireless hotspot.
        Step 1: Configure the hotspot settings:
            EG.
                netsh wlan set hostednetwork mode=allow ssid=HotspotName key=HotspotPassword

                    mode=allow: Enables the hosted network.
                    ssid=HotspotName: Sets the name of the network.
                    key=HotspotPassword: Sets the password (minimum 8 characters).
            
        Step 2: Start the hotspot:
            EG.
                netsh wlan start hostednetwork

        Step 3: Stop the hotspot:
            EG.
                netsh wlan stop hostednetwork

        Step 4: View hosted network settings:
            EG.
                netsh wlan show hostednetwork


11. Monitoring Wi-Fi Statistics
    - Check connection details and signal strength:
        EG.
            netsh wlan show interfaces


12. Exporting and Importing Wi-Fi Profiles  
    - Export saved Wi-Fi profiles to back them up or transfer them to another machine.
        EG: Export.
            netsh wlan export profile key=clear folder="C:\WiFiBackup"

                - This saves all profiles to the specified folder, including their passwords.

        EG: Import.
            netsh wlan add profile filename="C:\WiFiBackup\ProfileName.xml"


13.  Viewing Signal Strength of Wi-Fi Networks
    - List all available networks with their signal strengths:
        EG.
            netsh wlan show networks mode=bssid


14. Change Power Settings of Wi-Fi Adapter
    - Enable or disable power-saving mode for the wireless adapter:
        EG.
            netsh wlan set power mode=high

                - Options: low, medium, or high.


15. Troubleshooting Connection Issues
    - Diagnose problems with a network connection:
        EG.
            netsh wlan show all

                - This displays all networks, profiles, and adapter details.
