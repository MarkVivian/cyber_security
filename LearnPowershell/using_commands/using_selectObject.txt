                    SELECT OBJECT.
                =====================
- The Select-Object cmdlet in PowerShell allows you to choose and display specific properties from objects returned by other cmdlets. 
- It's a versatile tool for customizing the output you see in the console or for further processing in your scripts.


- Basic usage while selecting multiple properties.
    EG.
        Get-Process | Select-Object Name, Id

            - This command retrieves all running processes and displays only the Name and Id properties for each process using Select-Object.


- wildcard characters.
    EG.
        Get-Process | Select-Object Name, *Working*

            - This selects Name and all properties containing "Working" in their name (e.g., CPUWorkingSet, WorkingDirectory).


- Excluding Properties.
    EG.
        Get-Process | Select-Object -ExcludeProperty Description

            - This selects all properties except Description for each process.


-  Format output 
    EG.
        Get-Process | Select-Object Name, CPU -Format Table

            - This displays Name and CPU properties of processes in a table format.
