                    SELECT OBJECT.
                =====================
- The Select-Object cmdlet in PowerShell allows you to choose and display specific properties from objects returned by other cmdlets. 
- It's a versatile tool for customizing the output you see in the console or for further processing in your scripts.


            BASIC SYNTAX.
        =====================
EG.
    Select-Object [-Property] <Object[]> [-ExcludeProperty <String[]>] [-ExpandProperty <String>] [-First <Int32>] [-Last <Int32>] [-Unique]

    -Property: Specifies the properties (or columns) to include in the output. You can specify one or more property names.
    -ExcludeProperty: Specifies properties to exclude from the output.
    -ExpandProperty: Expands a single property that contains objects, showing its contents directly.
    -First: Limits the output to the first n objects.
    -Last: Limits the output to the last n objects.
    -Unique: Removes duplicates from the output, returning only unique values.


                    USAGES.
                =================
1. selecting multiple specific properties.
    EG.
        Get-Process | Select-Object Name, Id

            - This command retrieves all running processes and displays only the Name and Id properties for each process using Select-Object.


2. wildcard characters.
    EG.
        Get-Process | Select-Object Name, *Working*

            - This selects Name and all properties containing "Working" in their name (e.g., CPUWorkingSet, WorkingDirectory).


3. Excluding Properties.
    EG.
        Get-Process | Select-Object -ExcludeProperty Description

            - This selects all properties except Description for each process.


4. Format output 
    EG.
        Get-Process | Select-Object Name, CPU -Format Table

            - This displays Name and CPU properties of processes in a table format.


5. Expand properties.
    - If a property contains a nested object (like an array or object), you can expand it to show its contents directly using -ExpandProperty.
        EG. 
            Get-ItemProperty "HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Uninstall\*" | Select-Object -ExpandProperty DisplayName

            - This command will show just the DisplayName values (without extra metadata) for all software listed in the registry.


6. Limit results.
    - Sometimes you might not want all results, just the first or last few.
        > First:    
            EG.
                Get-Process | Select-Object Name, CPU -First 5

                - This will only show the first 5 processes with their names and CPU usage.

        > LAST:
            EG.
                Get-Process | Select-Object Name, CPU -Last 5

                - This will show the last 5 processes in the list.


7. Get Unique values.
    - If you're dealing with repeated values and want to see only unique entries, you can use -Unique.
        EG.
            Get-Process | Select-Object Name -Unique

            - This will show the unique process names, removing duplicates.
