                            TEST CONNECTION.
                        =======================
- It is used to test network connectivity between your computer and another device .
- it is similar to ping command but more functionality and flexibility.


                BASIC USAGE.
            -----------------
EG.
    Test-Connection [-ComputerName] <String[]> [-Count <Int32>] [-Delay <Int32>] [-Source <String[]>] [-Quiet] [<CommonParameters>]


            COMMON PARAMETERS AND VARIANTS.
        -------------------------------------
> ComputerName.
    - Specifies the target computer or device.
    - This can be a hostname, IP address, or a fully qualified domain name (FQDN).

> Count.
    - Specifies the number of echo requests to send (default is 4).

> Delay.    
    - Specifies the interval between echo requests in seconds.

> Source.
    - Specifies the source address from which the test connection is sent.
    - This is useful in multi-homed environments where a machine has multiple network interfaces.
    
> Quiet.
    - If specified, returns a boolean value indicating success or failure rather than detaileld output.


            EXAMPLES.
        ---------------
1) Basic ping.
    - Ping a single computer or device.
        EG.
            Test-Connection -ComputerName google.com

                - This will send 4 echo requests to `google.com`


2) Specifying the number of echo requests.
    - Ping a computer with a specified number of echo requests.
        EG.
            Test-Connection -ComputerName google.com -Count 10

                - This will send 10 echo requests to `google.com`.


3) Continuous Ping with delay.
    - Ping a computer continuously with a delay between each request.
        EG.
            while ($true) {
                Test-Connection -ComputerName google.com -Count 1 -Delay 5
            }

                - This sends a single echo request every 5 seconds to `google.com` until you stop the script.


4) Ping Multiple Computers.
    - Ping multiple Computers at once.
        EG.
            Test-connection -ComputerName google.com, microsoft.com, yahoo.com 

                 - This sends 4 echo requests to each specified computer and displays the results.


5) Using quiet mode.
    - Check if a computer is reachable, returning only a boolean value.
        EG.
            if (Test-Connection -ComputerName google.com -Quiet) {
                Write-Host "google.com is reachable."
            } else {
                Write-Host "google.com is not reachable."
            }

                - This will output a message indicating whether `google.com` is reachable.


6) Using Source Parameter.
    - specify theh source address for the echo request.
        EG.
            Test-Connection -ComputerName google.com -Source "192.168.1.2"

                - This sends the echo request from the specified source IP address `192.168.1.2`.
