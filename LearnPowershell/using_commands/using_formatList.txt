                                                FORMAT LIST.
                                            ==================
- This is a vertical, verbose dump - every property on its own line.

- Use it when:
    > You need to see all properties, especially long/complex ones.
    > You're inspecting objects with nested properties.
    > Output is too wide for a table.


            SYNTAX.
        --------------
EG.
    Format-List [-Property] <string[]> [-GroupBy] [-Force]


            EXAMPLES.
        -----------------
1. Format entire object vertically.
    EG.
        Get-Process | Format-List

            - Will output every property of every process.
            - Expect of scroll.


2. Format only specific properties.
    EG.
        Get-Process | Format-List Name, Id, CPU

            - Cleaner than full dump.
            - Easier to read than a table if values are long.


3. Inspect deeply nested object properties.
    EG.
        Get-WmiObject Win32_OperatingSystem | Format-List *

            - WMI objects can have 50+ properties. 
            - This gives you full detail.


4. Wildcard selection.
    EG.
        Get-Service | Format-List *name*

            - Shows all properties that contain "name" in them: Name, DisplayName, ServiceName, etc...


5. Group Output.
    EG.
        Get-Process | Format-List Name, CPU -GroupBy PriorityClass

            - Output will be grouped just like with Format-Table, but in a vertical layout:
                EG.
                        High
                        ----
                        Name : powershell
                        CPU  : 12.25

                        Normal
                        ------
                        Name : chrome
                        CPU  : 30.55
                        ...


6. Force show hidden properties.
    - Some properties are hidden in default view (like raw .psobject metadata). Force them out:
        EG.
            $object | Format-List * -Force


| Issue                               | Fix                                               |
| ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Piped to `Export-Csv` gives garbage | `Format-List` outputs text, not structured data   |
| Output is very verbose              | Use specific properties, or `Select-Object` first |
| Hidden properties missing           | Use `-Force`                                      |
