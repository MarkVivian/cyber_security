- -join is an operator used to concatenate elements of an array into a single string, separated by a specified delimiter. 
- It is not specific to file system paths.

    EG.
        $parts = @("C:", "Users", "Mark", "Desktop", "Scripts", "powershell")
        $joinedPath = $parts -join "\"
        Write-Host "Joined Path: $joinedPath"
