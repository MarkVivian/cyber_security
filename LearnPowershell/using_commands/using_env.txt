                    ENV 
                ===========

                    COMMON USES
                ==================
- if you want to list all the env you can use:
    EG.
        Get-ChildItem env:

            - if you want to get a specific variable.
                EG.
                    Get-ChildItem env:APPDATA


- To set a new env variable but only for the current session: NB:: for persistency use the $profile powershell script.
    EG.
        Set-Item env:<give it a name> -Value <what it will represent>
            EG.
                Set-Item env:Script -Value "path/to/script/folder"


- To add a path to the env:Path.
    > you can use the environment variables gui and add to the paths for persistency.
    > use the $profile.
    > from terminal: (not persistent. only affects current powershell session.)
        EG.
            $env:PATH += ";C:\path\to\script\folder"


- To remove a environment variable .
    EG.
        Remove-Item env:PATH.


- we can use $ since it says that the word is a variable thus allowing you to access the variable:

        EG.
            $env:COMPUTERNAME


    - Accessing User Profile Path.
