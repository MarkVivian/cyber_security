                            MEASURE OBJECT.
                        ===================
- Measure-Object is used to calculate properties of objects, such as counting the number of objects, summing, finding averages, and more.

        SYNTAX.
    =============
    EG.
        Measure-Object [[-Property] <String[]>] [-Sum] [-Minimum] [-Maximum] [-Average] [-StandardDeviation] [-Line] [-Character] [-Word] [-InputObject <PSObject>] [<CommonParameters>]


            BASIC USAGE.
        ==================
1. Counting Objects in a Collection
    EG.
        # Counts the number of files in the current directory
        Get-ChildItem | Measure-Object

        OUTPUT.
            Count    : 10


2. Summing the size of files.
    EG.
        # Sums the sizes of all .txt files in a directory
        Get-ChildItem -Path "C:\Files\*.txt" | Measure-Object -Property Length -Sum

        OUTPUT.
            Count    : 5
            Sum      : 10240  # Total size in bytes


3. Finding Minimum, Maximum, and Average Values
    EG.
        # Calculates min, max, and average file sizes
        Get-ChildItem -Path "C:\Files\*.txt" | Measure-Object -Property Length -Minimum -Maximum -Average

        OUTPUT.
            Count    : 5
            Average  : 2048
            Sum      : 10240
            Maximum  : 4096
            Minimum  : 512


4. Counting Lines, Words, and Characters in Text Files
    EG.
        # Counts lines, words, and characters in a text file
        Get-Content -Path "C:\Files\example.txt" | Measure-Object -Line -Word -Character

        OUTPUT.
            Lines     : 50
            Words     : 500
            Characters: 2500


5. Measuring the Length of Strings
    - You can use Measure-Object to calculate the total length of strings in an array.
        EG.
            # Measures the total length of all strings in an array
            @("PowerShell", "is", "awesome!") | Measure-Object -Property Length -Sum

            OUTPUT.
                Count    : 3
                Sum      : 20


6. Standard Deviation Calculation
    - You can calculate the standard deviation of numeric properties.
        EG.
            # Calculates standard deviation of file sizes
            Get-ChildItem -Path "C:\Files\*.txt" | Measure-Object -Property Length -StandardDeviation
            OUTPUT.
                Count              : 5
                StandardDeviation  : 1414.2135623731


3. Measure-Object with Grouping
    - Measure-Object can be combined with other cmdlets like Group-Object to perform more complex calculations.
        EG.
            # Groups files by extension and measures the count and total size for each group
            Get-ChildItem -Path "C:\Files\*" | Group-Object Extension | ForEach-Object {
                [PSCustomObject]@{
                    Extension = $_.Name
                    Count     = $_.Count
                    TotalSize = ($_.Group | Measure-Object -Property Length -Sum).Sum
                }
            }
