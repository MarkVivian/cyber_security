to see all the wifi's that a device has connected to we use the command:
	Eg.
		--> netsh wlan show profile

if you want a specific password of a specific device we use the command:
	EG.
		--> netsh wlan show profile name="wifi name goes here" key=clear
	
	look for the key content and there the password will be displayed.
