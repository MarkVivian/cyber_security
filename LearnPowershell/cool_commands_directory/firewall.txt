				FIREWALL 
			====================
- we can enable and disable the firewall from an elavated powershell using the command:
	EG.
		set-NetFirewallProfile -profile Domain,Public,Private -Enabled True/false # True enables the firewall and false disables it.
																																# You can also disable specific networks like Public alone.
