- to run the ps1/powershell scripts its better to set the execution policy to either
    i) unrestricted
    ii)RemoteSigned

    - you can check the current execution policy using:
        EG.
            get-executionPolicy

            - if it is either:
                i) Restricted
                ii) allSigned

                - it means that your scripts won't be able to run.


- to change the execution policy we need an admin powershell where we will run:
    EG.
        set-executionPolicy unrestricted
            OR
        set-executionPolicy remoteSigned

        - then you can run the script.
