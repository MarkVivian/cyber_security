            ERROR ACTIONS
        ======================
- Controls how powershell handles errors that occur during command execution.
- Available options include:
    > SilentlyContinue: Ignores the error and continues execution.
    > Stop: Stops execution immediately upon encountering an error.
    > Continue: Continues execution but records the error.
    > Inquire: Prompts the user for further action (like retry or skip) upon encountering an error.

        EG.
            Get-Process -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue  # Ignores any errors during Get-Process
