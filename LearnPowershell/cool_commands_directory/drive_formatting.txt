						USB DRIVE EJECTING
					==========================
- To see all the volumes in your windows we use:
	EG.
		Get-Volume
								
						
						FORMATTING A DRIVE
					============================
- We first need to access a terminal that can format drives using the command:
	EG.
		diskpart
			--> it requires admin privileges.
		

- In the diskpart terminal, we need to locate the disk we want to format.
- We use the command:
	EG.
		list disk
		

- Identify the disk you want to format from the list of disks displayed. Note the disk number of the target disk.
- Select the disk by typing:
	EG.
		select disk {disk number} --> select disk 1
			--> Replace {disk number} with the number of the disk you want to format.


- Confirm that you've selected the correct disk by typing:
	EG.
		detail disk
			--> This command provides detailed information about the selected disk, including its size and status.


- Once you've confirmed the selection, proceed to clean the disk to remove any existing partitions or volumes. Type:
	EG.
		clean
			--> This command erases all partitions and volumes from the selected disk.


- to convert drive from gpt to mbr we use
		convert mbr


- After cleaning the disk, create a new partition on it. You can do this by typing:
	EG.
		create partition primary
			--> This command creates a new primary partition on the disk.

			--> If you want to create a new partition with a specified partition size.
				EG.
					create partition primary size=SIZE 


- Then we select the volume you want to provide an ntfs:
	EG.
		select volume {volume number} --> select volume 2


- Now, format the partition with a file system of your choice. For example, to format the partition with the NTFS file system, type:
	EG.
		format fs=ntfs quick
			--> This command quickly formats the partition with the NTFS file system. Replace "ntfs" with the desired file system type if necessary.


- Once the formatting is complete, assign a drive letter to the newly formatted partition using the following command:
	EG.
		assign letter={drive letter}
			--> Replace {drive letter} with the letter you want to assign to the partition (e.g., "D", "E", etc.).


- You can now exit the diskpart utility by typing:
	EG.
		exit
			--> This command exits the diskpart utility and returns you to the regular command prompt.

- List Disks:
    > In the diskpart prompt, type:

    		select volume Z

    			> Replace Z with the volume number.

		EG.
			delete partition

	> For volumes:
		EG.
    		delete volume


- Extend the Remaining Volume:

		EG.
			select partition Y
