				GREP
			=============
to use grep in windows we use the command:
	select-string
		or
	findstr

findstr is more case sensetive compared to select-string.

	EG.
		--> get-content filename | select-string "certain string here"
			OR
		--> get-content filename | findstr "certain string here with case sensitivity"
