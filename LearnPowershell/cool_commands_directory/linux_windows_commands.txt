				GREP
			=============
to use grep in windows we use the command:
	select-string
		or
	findstr

findstr is more case sensetive compared to select-string.

	EG.
		--> get-content filename | select-string "certain string here"
			OR
		--> get-content filename | findstr "certain string here with case sensitivity"


also we can use :
	Filter
Used to filter the output of a cmdlet based on specific criteria.
Accepts various filtering expressions using operators like:
	 -eq (equal to), 
	 -ne (not equal to), 
	 -gt (greater than), 
	 -lt (less than), 
	 -like (wildcard matching),
	 and more.

	 EG.
	 	Get-Process -Filter { Name -like "notepad*" }  # Filters processes whose names start with "notepad"
			OR
		get-childItem C:\ -Recurse -Filter OSPPREARM.EXE
