to get the wifi passwords you need admin previlages on the working pc.

switch directories to the:
	/etc/NetworkManager/system-connections/

Here you will see multiple networks that the pc has connected to previously.
Choose the network that you want to see and read it.
the password is stored in the psk.
	EG.
		cat NYK\ BANKING\ HALL.nmconnection | grep psk

		OUTPUT.
			key-mgmt=wpa-psk
			psk=NYK@031!
