                        BLUETOOTHCTL
                    =====================
we use the bluetoothctl to access our bluetooth adapter.    
in the terminal we use:
    1) make sure the bluetooth controller is powered on.
        EG.
            power on


    2) make the controller discoverable to other devices.
        EG.
            discoverable on


    3) start scanning for nearby bluetooth devices.
        EG.
            scan on

            - you should see a list of nearby devices appearing.
            - Note the MAC address of the device you want to connect to.


    4) pair with the device using its mac address.
        EG.
            pair <MAC ADDRESS>

    
    5) connect to the device after pairing.
        EG.
            connet <MAC ADDRESS>


    6) Disconnect from the device.
        EG.
            disconnect <MAC ADDRESS>

    
    7) once connected to a device turn off scanning.
        EG.
            scan off.


    8) exit


    9) if you have multiple bluetooth adapters we can list them:
        EG.
            list

            - this will display the adapters with their addresses and names.


    10) select the desired adapter.
        EG.
            select <adapter address>


    11) power on the selected adapter.
        EG.
            power on.
            
    
    12) to display all the connected mac addresses.
        EG.
            devices.
            
            
    13) to remove a connected device we use :
        EG.
            remove <device mac address>
