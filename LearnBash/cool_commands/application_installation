                APPLICATION INSTALLATION
             =============================
- if you clone an application we can move it to the directory:
    EG.
        mv ~/directory /opt/
        
            - /opt/ -> this is where most application data is .
            

- if you want to create a link between the application such that it can be run from anywhere in the terminal we use:
    EG.
        sudo ln -s /path/to/app/directory /usr/local/bin
        
        
- the difference between /usr/local/bin and /usr/bin is that:
    /usr/bin - used by system application and easily upgraded by using sudo apt.
    
    /usr/local/bin - used to create links especially to applications that have been manually downloaded.
