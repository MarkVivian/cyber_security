				RECOVER PASSWORD
			===========================
- Boot into recovery mode (usually available in the GRUB menu during startup).
- Choose the root shell prompt option.
- Remount the root filesystem with read-write access:
	EG.
		mount -o remount,rw /

- Reset the password for a specific user (replace [username] with the actual username):
	EG.
		passwd [username]

- Set a new password when prompted.
- Reboot your machine and log in with the new password.

- we can also get all the users in a linux system using:
	EG.
		cat /etc/passwd 
			--> This will display a list of all users along with additional details like their home directory, login shell, and more.

- we can also use the getent command to retrieve info from databases, including user accounts.
	EG.
		getent passwd

- we can also use the users command to list currently logged-in users.
	EG.
		users.
