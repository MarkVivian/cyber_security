            ELEVATED SCRIPTS.
        =======================
- The configuration file for the sudo is /etc/sudoers and should only be edited using visudo.
- Edit the sudoers File with visudo:
    EG.
        sudo visudo 



            EXAMPLE OF A RULE
        ======================
- The general format of a rule is:
    EG.
        user host=(runas) command.
            
            -user : The user or a group of users who can run the command.
            -host : The hosts where the user(s) can run the command (usually `ALL` means any host)
            -runas : The user the command will be run as (typically `ALL` for any user)
            -command : The command or commands the user can run (can include wildcards)


- Add the necessary  line:
    EG.
        mark ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /path/to/your_script.sh

            -mark : The user `mark`.
            -ALL : can run on any host.
            -(ALL) : Can run the command as any user (`root` or any other user)
            -NOPASSWD : Does not require a password.
            -/path/to/script.sh : path to the script that can be run with elevated priveleges without a password.


- If you want to make a whole command like shutdown or nmap to run without needing sudo:
    EG.
        which <command name> ---> which nmap # locate the path to the command.
              OR
        whereis <command name>
             OR
        locate <command name>          
                        OR                     
        sudo su
            AND
        which shutdown                      # if the command requires sudo, go into root then use which.

            -then add the command path to the visudo:
                EG.
                    mark ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/nmap


- Disabling password requirement for all commands.
    EG.
        mark ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL

            - allows the user mark to run any command as any user without entering a password.
