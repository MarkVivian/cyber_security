                            PATH FORMATTING.
                        ====================
1. DIRNAME
    - The dirname command extracts the directory portion of a given file path by removing the file name and any trailing slashes.
        BASIC SYNTAX.
        -----------------
        EG.
            dirname [OPTION] PATH

            i. Extracting the directory from a full path:
                EG.
                    dirname /home/user/documents/file.txt

            ii.  Handling paths without slashes:
                EG.
                    dirname filename.txt

            iii.  Using with multiple paths:
                EG.
                    dirname /home/user/file.txt /home/user/anotherfile.txt


2. REALPATH
    - The realpath command resolves all symbolic links, relative paths, and returns the absolute path of a file or directory.
        BASIC SYNTAX.
        --------------
        EG.
            realpath [OPTION] PATH

            i.  Getting the absolute path of a file:
                EG.
                    realpath ./myfile.txt

            ii.  Resolving symbolic links:
                EG.
                    realpath /usr/bin/python3


3. $0
    - $0 refers to the name of the script being executed.
    - It can be used to determine how the script was called.    
        i. Displaying the script name:
            EG.
                echo "Script name: $0"


4. BASENAME
    - The basename command extracts the filename from a given path, removing the directory components.
        BASIC SYNTAX.
        --------------
            EG.
                basename [OPTION] PATH [SUFFIX]

                i.  Extracting the filename:
                    EG.
                        basename /home/user/documents/file.txt

                ii.  Removing a specific suffix:
                    EG.
                        basename /home/user/documents/file.txt .txt
