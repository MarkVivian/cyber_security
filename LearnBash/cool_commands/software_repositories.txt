                         SOFTWARE REPOSITORY.
                    ==========================
- A software repository in Linux is a storage location from which your system retrieves and installs software packages. 
- These repositories contain precompiled packages that you can install and update using package management tools like apt.


            HOW REPOSITORIES WORK.
        -----------------------------
1) Configuration : 
    - Your Linux system is configured to know where to find repositories. 
    - This configuration is usually done through files located in:
        > /etc/apt/sources.list 
            OR
        > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ (for Debian-based systems like Ubuntu).


2) Updating package lists : 
    - When you run sudo apt update, your system updates its list of available packages from the repositories. 
    - This command fetches the latest package information from the repositories.


3) Installing Packages:
    - After updating the package list, you can install software using commands like sudo apt install <package_name>. 
    - This command downloads the package from the repository and installs it on your system.


4) Upgrading Packages:
    - You can upgrade all the installed packages to their latest versions using sudo apt upgrade.



                    EXAMPLE OF REPOSITORIES
                ================================
1) Default Repositories: 
    - When you install a Linux distribution, it comes with a set of default repositories. 
    - For example, on Ubuntu, you have:

        > Main: Officially supported free and open-source software.
        > Universe: Community-maintained free and open-source software.
        > Restricted: Proprietary drivers for devices.
        > Multiverse: Software that is not free.


2) Adding a New Repository:
    - Sometimes, you might need software that is not available in the default repositories. 
    - You can add a new repository. Hereâ€™s how you can do it:

        EG:- Adding a PPA (Personal Package Archive) for a specific software:
            sudo add-apt-repository ppa:some/ppa
            sudo apt update

        
        EG:- Adding a repository directly:
            echo "deb http://repository.url/ubuntu bionic main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/newrepo.list
            sudo apt update


3) Removing a repository.
    - you can remove it using the --remove option.
        EG.
            sudo add-apt-repository --remove ppa:some/ppa

    - If the repository was added manually, you'll need to delete the relevant entry from the configuration files.

        > Edit /etc/apt/sources.list:
            - Open the file in a text editor and remove the line corresponding to the repository you want to remove.
                EG.
`                   sudo nano /etc/apt/sources.list
`
            - Find the line with the repository URL and delete it, then save and exit (in Nano, press Ctrl+O to save and Ctrl+X to exit).


        > Edit files in /etc/apt/sources.list.d/:
            - Repositories are often added as separate files in this directory. Find and delete the specific repository file.
                EG.
                    sudo rm /etc/apt/sources.list.d/repository-name.list
