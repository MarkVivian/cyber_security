        /usr/share/sounds/freedesktop/stereo/: Standard sounds for desktop notifications (e.g., complete.oga).
        /usr/share/sounds/gnome/: GNOME desktop-specific sounds.
        /usr/share/sounds/KDE/: KDE desktop-specific sounds.

    - If you're using a custom desktop environment or distribution, this path might vary.


3. /usr/share/icons/ — System Icons
    - Icons used by system applications, including the default icons for the desktop environment, are stored here.
    - Icons are organized by sizes and themes.

    - Common directories:
        /usr/share/icons/hicolor/: Default icon theme for GNOME and other applications.

4. /usr/bin/ and /usr/sbin/ — System Applications
    - System-wide executable applications are stored in these directories.

        /usr/bin/: Standard executables that can be run by any user. For example, system utilities like ls, cp, notify-send, etc.
        /usr/sbin/: System binaries typically only used by the root user. Examples include iptables, systemctl, etc.


5. /home/ — User-Specific Files
    - This is where user-specific data, such as settings and configuration files, are stored.

        /home/user/: Each user has their own directory here, where their personal files, scripts, and application configurations are stored.
            /home/user/.config/: Configuration files for applications (e.g., notify-send, system settings).
            /home/user/.local/: Local user-specific applications and libraries.


6. /etc/ — System Configuration Files
    - This directory contains system-wide configuration files for various system services and applications.

    - Common files in /etc/:
        /etc/hostname: The system's hostname.
        /etc/passwd: User account information.
        /etc/crontab: System-wide cron jobs.
        /etc/pulse/: PulseAudio configuration files (for sound setup).


7. /dev/ — Device Files
- This directory contains device files, which represent physical or virtual devices on the system, such as hard drives, sound cards, etc.

    Examples:
        /dev/sda: Primary hard drive.
        /dev/audio or /dev/snd/: Sound-related devices (if you're using ALSA or PulseAudio).


8. /tmp/ — Temporary Files
    - This is a temporary storage area for files that are needed only for the duration of a process.
    - It may be used by some applications (like browsers or audio services).

    Example:
        /tmp/pulseaudio.socket: PulseAudio socket, which can vary depending on configuration. You might want to confirm if this is where PulseAudio is running or if it's different for your session.


9. /usr/share/wallpapers/
    System-wide wallpapers: This directory contains wallpapers that are available to all users on the system.
    Customization: You can add your own wallpapers to this directory to make them accessible to all users.


10. /home/<username>/.config/
    User-specific configuration: This directory stores configuration files for various applications, including your desktop environment.

    Desktop Environment Settings:
        GNOME: Check the gnome-shell directory for themes, extensions, and other settings.
        KDE: Look in the kde directory for KDE-specific configurations.

    Wallpaper Settings:
