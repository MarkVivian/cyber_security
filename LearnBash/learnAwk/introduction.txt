                                INTRODUCTION TO AWK.
                            ============================
- awk is a powerful text-processing tool in Linux, used to search, extract, and manipulate text from files or standard input.
- It processes text line by line and splits each line into fields based on delimiters (default is whitespace).


        BASIC STRUCTURE.
    ------------------------
EG.
    awk 'pattern { action }' file

        - pattern: A condition to match lines (e.g., lines containing a specific word or pattern).
        - action: Commands executed for lines matching the pattern.
        - file: The input file (or standard input if omitted).


            EXAMPLE.
        ------------------
1. Print All Lines
    eg.
        awk '{ print }' file.txt

            > Prints every line from file.txt.
            > { print } is the default action, equivalent to just awk '' file.txt.
