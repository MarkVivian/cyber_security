                SORT COMMAND
              ======================
- we can sort files using the command:
    EG.
        sort filename
        
    1) we can also sort in reverse order.
        EG.
            sort -r filename
            
    2) we can also sort numerically instead of alphabetically.
        EG.
            sort -n filename
            
    3) also we can sort based on a specific column within the file. (seperated by spaces or tabs)
        EG.
            sort -k 2 filename # sort based on the second column.
            
    4) remove duplicate lines
        EG.
            sort -u filename # similar to unique.
            
    5) ingores case sensetivity during sorting.
        EG.
            sort -f filename.
