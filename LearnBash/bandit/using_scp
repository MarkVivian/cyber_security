                SCP
            ============
- This is a secure copy utility for securely transferring files between hosts on a network.
- Uses SSH (secure shell) to provide encryption.
- Common options:
    -r: Recursively copy entire directories.
    -P port: Specify the SSH port to use (capital P).
    -p: Preserves modification times, access times, and modes from the original file.
    -q: Disables the progress meter.
    -C: Enables compression.

- Common uses include:
    1) copy a file from a local system to a remote system.
        EG.
            scp ./local_file username@remote_host:path/to/destination


    2) copy a file from remote system to a local system
        EG.
            scp username@remote_host:path/to/file ./local_machine


    3) copy a file between two remote systems
        EG.
            scp username1@remotehost1:/path/to/remotefile username2@remotehost2:/path/to/destination


    4) copy a directory recursively
        EG.
            scp -r localdir username@remotehost:/path/to/destination
