                        NETCAT(nc)
                    ===============
- is a versatile networking tool taht can be used for a variety of purposes, including:
    >> port scanning
    >> transferring files
    >> acting as a simple server or client

                
                    COMMON USES     
                ==================      
- When conducting reverse shell attacks we do not connect to a machine we wait for the machine to connect to us. To do this we need to create a listener to listen for a connection to our machine on a certain port that we are going to specify.
	EG.
		nc -lnvp 87  -->  nc -lnvp <port number>

			-l :- Listen mode for inbound connects.

			-n :- Numeric-only ip addresses, no dns.

			-v :- verbose. will give us all the info. 

			-p :- local port number.


- connect to a remote host:
    EG. 
        nc hostname port --> nc example.com 80


- Listening for incoming connections.
    EG.
        nc -l -p port ----> nc -l -p 1234


- Port scanning.
    EG. [[tcp connection]]
        nc -zv hostname start_port-end_port ----> nc -zv example.com 80-100

    EG. [[udp connections]]
        nc -zvu hostname start_port-end_port ----> nc -zvu example.com 80-100


- Transferring files from sender to reciever.
    EG. [[Sender]]
        nc -l -p port < filename 

            EG.<<transferring file.txt on port 12345>>
                nc -l -p 12345 < file.txt

    EG. [[Receiver]]
        nc hostname port > filename

            EG.<<receive file.txt from hostname on port 12345>>
                nc localhost 12345 > file1.txt


- Transferring files from reciever to sender.
    EG. [[Sender]]
        nc -l -p port > filename 

            EG.<<transferring file.txt on port 12345>>
                nc -l -p 12345 > file.txt

    EG. [[Receiver]]
        nc hostname port < filename

            EG.<<receive file.txt from hostname on port 12345>>
                nc localhost 12345 < file1.txt


- connect to a remote server and send data
    EG.
        echo "hello world" | nc example.com 12345


- Set a timeout for a connection.
    EG.
        nc -w 5 example.com 12345


- execute a command 
    EG.
        nc -l -p 4440 -e /bin/bash


- Running netcat in the background:
    EG.
        nc -l -p 12345 &
