                            GZIP
                        ============
- Compression progression:
    |  tool | Speed     | Compression Ratio | 
    |-------|-----------|-------------------|
    | gzip  | Fast      | Moderate          |
    | bzip2 | Slow      | High              |
    | xz    | Very Slow | Very High         |

- GZIP files are compressed files that use the gzip compression algorithm.
- identified by :  
    * the .gz file extension.
    * the magic number at the start of the file: 1F 8B 
        > This is a signature that identifies the file as a gzip-compressed file.
        > The magic number can be viewed using tools like xxd or hexdump.
            EG.
                xxd ./filename | head | grep '1f8b'  
                    
                    > xxd displays the file in hexadecimal format; head limits to first lines; grep searches for the magic number.

                    OR

                xxd -l 2 ./filename | grep '1f8b' 
                    
                    > xxd -l 2 means to print only the first 2 words . 
                    > this will display the first lines of the file.

                    OR
                
                file ./filename
                    
                    > this will display the compression algorithm used.


                    USAGE.
                -----------------
1. Basic compression and decompression
    > compresses data using the:
        EG.
            gzip ./filename

                * This will create a compressed file named filename.gz in the same directory as the original file.

    > decompress data using:    
        EG.
            gunzip ./filename.gz

                OR
            
            gzip -d filename.gz

                * Does the decompressed file have to have .gz extension?
                    - No, gzip can decompress files regardless of their extension. However, by convention, gzip-compressed files typically have a .gz extension to indicate their compressed status.


2. Viewing contents of a gzip file without decompressing
    EG.
        zcat filename.gz

            - This command outputs the uncompressed contents of the gzip file to standard output without actually decompressing the file on disk.
        
            OR

        gzip -c -d filename.gz

            - The -c option tells gzip to write the decompressed data to standard output instead of creating a file.
            - The -d option specifies decompression.


3. Compressing multiple files into a single gzip file
    EG.
        tar -czf archive.tar.gz file1 file2 file3

            - The tar command is used to create an archive of multiple files.
            - The -c option creates a new archive.
            - The -z option compresses the archive using gzip.
                * Why is there a -z option here?
                    > The -z option is necessary because the archive is compressed with gzip.
                    > It tells tar to first decompress the archive before extracting its contents.
            - The -f option specifies the name of the output file (archive.tar.gz in this case).
            - what is the difference between .tar.gz and .tgz?
                > Both .tar.gz and .tgz are gzip-compressed tar archives.
                > The .tgz extension is simply a shorter version of .tar.gz, often used for convenience.
            

4. Decompressing a gzip-compressed tar archive
    EG.
        tar -xzf archive.tar.gz

            - The -x option extracts the contents of the archive.
            - The -z option decompresses the archive using gzip.
                * How does tar know the -z is for compression or decompression?
                    > The -z option is context-sensitive; when used with -c (create), it compresses, and when used with -x (extract), it decompresses.
            - The -f option specifies the name of the input file (archive.tar.gz in this case).
            - Why not decompress with gunzip first?
                > You could use gunzip to decompress the archive first, but using tar with the -z option is more efficient as it combines both decompression and extraction into a single step.

5. Checking the integrity of a gzip file
    EG.
        gzip -t filename.gz

            - The -t option tests the integrity of the gzip file without decompressing it.
            - If the file is intact, there will be no output; if there are issues, error messages will be displayed.
            - Is there a way to fix corrupted gzip files?
                > gzip does not have built-in functionality to repair corrupted files.
                > If a gzip file is corrupted, you may need to obtain a new copy of the file or use specialized recovery tools, but success is not guaranteed.


6. Adjusting compression level
    EG.
        gzip -1 filename      # Fastest compression, larger file size
        gzip -9 filename      # Slowest compression, smaller file size

            - The compression level can be adjusted from 1 (fastest, least compression) to 9 (slowest, most compression) using the -1 to -9 options.
            - What is the difference between compression levels?
                > Higher compression levels (like -9) take more time to compress the data but result in smaller file sizes.
                > Lower compression levels (like -1) are faster but produce larger compressed files.


7. Viewing compression statistics
    EG.
        gzip -l filename.gz

            - The -l option lists information about the compressed file, including the original size, compressed size, and compression ratio.


8. Keeping original files after compression
    EG.
        gzip -k filename

            - The -k option tells gzip to keep the original file after compression, resulting in both the original and compressed files being present.


9. Force compression or decompression
    EG.
        gzip -f filename

            - The -f option forces gzip to overwrite existing files without prompting.
            - This is useful when you want to ensure that the compression or decompression operation proceeds without interruption due to existing files.
            - Why would you use the -f option?
                > To automate scripts where you want to avoid manual confirmation prompts when overwriting files.
            - Caution: Using -f will overwrite files without warning, so use it carefully to avoid accidental data loss.
