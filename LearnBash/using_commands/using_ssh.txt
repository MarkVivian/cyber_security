                SSH
            ===========
Common comands:
    -p port: Specifies the port to connect to on the remote host. The default is 22.
    -i identity_file: Selects a file from which the identity (private key) for public key authentication is read.


1) basic ssh connection:
    EG.
        ssh user@remotehost

        - you can also use -l 
            EG.
                ssh -l user localhost


2) connecting to a remote-host on a non-default port
    EG.
        ssh -p 2222 user@remotehost


3) using a specific identity file (private key)
    EG.
        ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa user@remotehost
        

4) we can also run a command after ssh .
    EG.
        ssh user@remotehost <command to run> --> ssh user@remotehost ls ~       


5. if you want to ssh and pass the password without going through the authenticator.
    EG,
        sshpass -p "yourpassword" ssh -p <port> user@host 

            - warning the password will appear in ps listings or shell history.
