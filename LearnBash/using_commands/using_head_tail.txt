                            HEAD AND TAIL.
                        =====================
            TAIL.
        -----------
- The head command is used to display the beginning of a file. By default, it shows the first 10 lines of the file.

            Basic Syntax:
        -------------------------
EG.
    head [options] [file...]

  
        Examples:
    ------------------
> Show the First 10 Lines of a File:
    EG.
        head filename.txt

            - This command displays the first 10 lines of filename.txt.


> Show a Specific Number of Lines:
    EG.
        head -n 20 filename.txt

            - To display a different number of lines, use the -n option:
            -  This shows the first 20 lines of filename.txt.


> Show the First Few Bytes:
    EG.
        head -c 50 filename.txt

            - You can also display a specific number of bytes using the -c option:
            - This shows the first 50 bytes of filename.txt.


> Read from Standard Input:
    EG.
        echo -e "line1\nline2\nline3\nline4\nline5" | head -n 3

            - This shows the first 3 lines of the piped input.
            - You can use head to read from standard input (e.g., piped data):


            TAIL.
        ------------
- The tail command is used to display the end of a file. By default, it shows the last 10 lines of the file.

        Basic Syntax:
    ----------------------
EG.
    tail [options] [file...]

        Examples:
    ---------------
- Show the Last 10 Lines of a File:
    EG.
        tail filename.txt

            > This displays the last 10 lines of filename.txt.


- Show a Specific Number of Lines:
    EG.
        tail -n 20 filename.txt

            > Use the -n option to specify the number of lines:
            > This shows the last 20 lines of filename.txt.


- Show the Last Few Bytes:
    EG.
        tail -c 50 filename.txt

            > This shows the last 50 bytes of filename.txt.
            > To display a specific number of bytes, use the -c option:


- Follow a File in Real Time:
    EG
        tail -f /var/log/syslog

            > The -f option allows you to follow a file in real-time, which is useful for monitoring log files:
            > This shows new lines added to /var/log/syslog as they are written.


- Follow Multiple Files:
    EG.
        tail -f file1.log file2.log

            > This will display updates from both file1.log and file2.log.
            > You can follow multiple files at once:


- Using head and tail Together
    EG
        head -n 20 filename.txt | tail -n 10

            > You can use head and tail together to view specific sections of a file. For example, to view lines 11 to 20 of a file:
            > head -n 20 filename.txt extracts the first 20 lines.
            > tail -n 10 then extracts the last 10 lines from the output of head, giving you lines 11 to 20.
