                                REGULAR EXPRESSION (REGEX)
                            ==================================
- This are powerful tool for pattern matching and text manipuulation.
- They provide a concise and flexible way to describe and search for text pattern within strings.


                PATTERN BREAKDOWN.
            -------------------------
- Lets take ^[0-7*]$

    ^ : Matches the beginning of the string.
    [0-7*] : matches any single character from the set: 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7 or the asterisk (*).
    $ : Matches the end of the string.

    - The ^[0-7*]$ pattern specifically checks if a string:
        - starts with a character from 0 to 7.
        - Contains any number of characters from 0 to 7 or asterisks in between.
        - Ends with a character from 0 to 7.


- Lets take ^[0-9]+$

    ^: matches the beginning of the string.
    [0-9]: matches any single digit from 0 to 9.
    + : matches one or more occurrences of the preceding element ([0-9]).
    $ : matches the end of the string.

    - The ^[0-9]+$ pattern effectively checks if a string:
        - Starts with a digit.
        - Contains one or more digits.
        - Ends with a digit.
