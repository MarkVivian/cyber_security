                FIND COMMAND
             =======================
- we use the find command to:
    
    1) find a file by the name
        EG.
            find . -name "*.txt"
                -this option searches for files with a specific name.
                
            find . -iname "important"
                - this option performs a case sensetive search for filenames.
    
    
    2) find a directory or file by its type
        EG.
            find ./* -type f    
                - looks for files only
                
            find ./* -type d
                - looks for directories only
         
                
    3) find by permissions.
        EG.
            find . -perm <permission code> --> find . -perm -664
                                               find . -perm /222
                                               find . -perm /u+w,g+w
                                               find . -perm /u=w,g=w
                                               find . -perm -g+w,u+w
                - 1 > 001 > --x
                - 2 > 010 > -w-
                - 3 > 011 > r--
                
            
    4) find by size.
        EG.
            find . -size <size> --> find . -size +10M # find files larger than 10MB.
                                    find . -size -50k # find files smaller than 50KB.
                                    
               -> +<size>c: Search for files larger than a specified size (in bytes).
               -> -<size>c: Search for files smaller than a specified size (in bytes).
               -> k: Denotes size in kilobytes (1024 bytes).
               -> M: Denotes size in megabytes (1048576 bytes).
               -> G: Denotes size in gigabytes (1073741824 bytes). 
               -> c: denotes size in bytes.
                    EG.
                        find . -size +100M # files larger than 100 megabytes.
                        find . -size -500k # files smaller than 500 kilobytes.
                        find . -size +1G   # files larger than 1 gigabyte.
                        find . -size -200c # files smaller than 200 bytes.
                        find . -size 50M   # files exactly 50 megabytes.
          
               
    5) find by date
        -mtime <days>: Search for files modified in the last <days> days.
        -atime <days>: Search for files accessed in the last <days> days.
        -ctime <days>: Search for files where the inode data changed in the last <days> days.
            EG.
                find -mtime <days> --> find . -mtime -7 # modified in the last week. 
                
                
    6) using exec with find
        - exec allows us to pass the output of the find command to another command.
            EG.
              find . -name "*.s" -exec <comand> {} \; --> find . -name "*.s" -exec cat {} \;
                
                    - the {} is where the output of find command will be passed to the command.
                    - the \; marks the end of the -exec command.
                    
    
    7) find using group and user.
            EG.
                find . -user <name> -group <name> -> find . -user bandit7 -group bandit6
                    
                    -user bandit7: This searches for files owned by the user named "bandit7".
                    -group bandit6: This searches for files owned by the group named "bandit6".
                    
                    
    8) find non executable and executable files.
            EG.
                find . ! -executable # for none executable files
                find . -executable # for executable files.
                    
                    -This searches for files that have execute permission for the user trying to run the find command (usually the current user).
                    
                    
    9) find but ignoring errors.
            EG.
                find . -name "*.sh" 2>/dev/null
                
                     - it will ignore any erronous output.
