                                    FTP (FILE TRANSFER PROTOCOL)
                                =====================================
- FTP is a standard network protocol used for transferring files between a client and a server over a TCP/IP connection.


        BASIC SYNTAX.
    ----------------------
EG.
    ftp [options] [hostname]

        > hostname:
            - The IP address or domain of the remote FTP server.
        
        > options:
            - Additional options for specific functionalities (e.g., enabling passive mode).


                COMMON USES.
            ------------------
1. Starting an FTP session
    - To start an FTP session, you simply type the command followed by the hostname or IP of the FTP server.
        EG.
            ftp ftp.example.com

                - This will prompt you for a username and password. Once authenticated, you'll enter an FTP session.


2. Uploading a File
    - Once connected, you can upload files using the put command.
        EG.
            put localfile.txt

                - This will upload localfile.txt from your local system to the current directory on the remote FTP server.


3. Downloading a File
    - You can download files from the remote server using the get command.
        EG.
            get remotefile.txt

                - This will download remotefile.txt from the server to your current local directory.


4. Navigating Directories
    - You can move between directories on the remote FTP server using cd and check where you are using pwd.
        > Change directory:
            EG.
                cd /path/to/directory

        > Print working directory:
            EG.
                pwd


5. Listing Files
    - To view the files on the remote server:
        EG.
            ls

                - This works similarly to the ls command in Linux, displaying files in the current directory.


6. Closing an FTP Session
    - You can exit an FTP session using the bye or quit commands.
        EG.
            bye


7. Using FTP with a Script (Batch mode)
    - To automate FTP tasks (e.g., downloading multiple files), you can create a script using ftp in non-interactive mode.
        EG.
            #!/bin/bash
            HOST='ftp.example.com'
            USER='username'
            PASSWD='password'

            ftp -n -v $HOST << EOF
            user $USER $PASSWD
            cd /path/to/directory
            get file.txt
            bye
            EOF


4. Other Useful Options

    -n: Disables auto-login upon starting an FTP session.
    -v: Enables verbose mode, printing out all commands being executed.

By using these options in your commands or scripts, you can manage FTP sessions more effectively.
