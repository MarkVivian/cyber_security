                                XXD
                            =========
- The xxd command in Unix-like systems is used for working with binary data.
- It can display the hex dump of a file (convert binary data to hexadecimal representation) and can also convert a hex dump format back into binary data.
- It can be identified by :
    * the .hexdump or .xxd file extension for hex dump files.
    * the .bin or .dat file extension for binary files.
- can xxd be used for files other than binary?
    - Yes, xxd can be used to create hex dumps of any type of file, including text files, images, executables, etc.
    - The hex dump provides a way to view the raw byte content of the file.
- hexdump files have the extension .hexdump or .xxd.
- binary files have the extension .bin or .dat.
- what does the hexdump command do?
    - The hexdump command displays the contents of a file in hexadecimal format, similar to xxd.

                
                UNDERSTANDING THE LAYOUT OF HEXDUMP OUTPUT.
            ----------------------------------------------------
- The output of xxd and hexdump typically consists of three main columns:
    1. Offset Column:
        - This column shows the byte offset from the beginning of the file, usually in hexadecimal format.
        - It helps you locate where in the file a particular byte or sequence of bytes is located.
    2. Hexadecimal Column:
        - This column displays the actual byte values of the file in hexadecimal format.
        - Each byte is represented by two hexadecimal digits (00 to FF).
        - The bytes are usually grouped in sets of 16 for easier reading.
    3. ASCII Column:
        - This column shows the ASCII representation of the byte values.    
        - Printable ASCII characters are displayed as they are, while non-printable characters are typically represented by a dot (.) or another placeholder.
        - This column helps you quickly identify human-readable text within the binary data.

- Example output of xxd:
    00000000: 4865 6c6c 6f2c 2057 6f72 6c64 210a       Hello, World!.

        - In this example:
            > The offset column shows "00000000", indicating the start of the file.
            > The hexadecimal column shows the byte values for "Hello, World!\n".
            > The ASCII column displays the corresponding characters.
                
                
                BASIC USAGE.
            --------------------
1. display a hexdump
    EG. 
        xxd filename
           OR 
        hexdump filename    # may look different due to the formatting options.
        hexdump -C filename  # canonical format, similar to xxd output.

            - This command reads the specified file and outputs its contents in a hexadecimal format alongside the ASCII representation.
            - why does the output of hexdump look different from xxd?
                > hexdump has different default formatting options compared to xxd, leading to variations in how the hex and ASCII data are presented.
                > xxd typically shows offsets, hex bytes, and ASCII characters in a more compact format, while hexdump may use a more spaced-out layout.

2. convert a hexdump file back to binary
    EG.
        xxd -r hexdump > binary_data

            - The -r option tells xxd to reverse the operation, converting the hex dump back into its original binary form.

3. converting a binary file to hexdump.
    EG.
        xxd binary_file > hexdump_file

            - This command reads the binary file and writes its hex dump representation to the specified hexdump file.

4. specifying number of bytes per line
    EG.
        xxd -c 8 filename

            - The -c option allows you to specify the number of bytes to display per line in the hex dump output. In this example, 8 bytes per line are shown instead of the default 16.

5. displaying only a specific number of bytes
    EG.
        xxd -l 32 filename
            OR 
        hexdump -n 64 filename
            
            - The -l option allows you to limit the output to a specific number of bytes. In this example, only the first 32 bytes of the file are displayed.
            - The -n option allows you to specify the number of bytes to display. In this example, only the first 64 bytes of the file are displayed.

6. displaying bytes from a specific offset
    EG.
        xxd -s 16 filename

            - The -s option allows you to specify a starting offset for the hex dump. In this example, the output starts from byte 16 of the file.


                IDENTIFYING FILE TYPES USING XXD OR HEXDUMP.
            ----------------------------------------------------
- You can use xxd or hexdump to examine the initial bytes of a file to identify its type based on known "magic numbers" or signatures.
- Many file formats have specific byte sequences at the beginning that can help identify them.

1. Identifying a PNG file
    - PNG files start with the following byte sequence: 89 50 4E 47 0D 0A 1A 0A
    EG.
        xxd -l 8 filename | grep '89504e470d0a1a0a'

            OR
        hexdump -n 8 filename | grep '89504e470d0a1a0a'

2. Identifying a JPEG file
    - JPEG files start with the byte sequence: FF D8 FF
    EG.
        xxd -l 3 filename | grep 'ffd8ff'

            OR
        hexdump -n 3 filename | grep 'ffd8ff'

3. Identifying a PDF file
    - PDF files start with the byte sequence: 25 50 44 46 2D
    EG.
        xxd -l 5 filename | grep '255044462d'

            OR
        hexdump -n 5 filename | grep '255044462d'

4. Identifying a ZIP file
    - ZIP files start with the byte sequence: 50 4B 03 04
    EG.
        xxd -l 4 filename | grep '504b0304'

            OR
        hexdump -n 4 filename | grep '504b0304'

5. Identifying a GZIP file
    - GZIP files start with the byte sequence: 1F 8B
    EG.
        xxd -l 2 filename | grep '1f8b'

            OR
        hexdump -n 2 filename | grep '1f8b'

6. Identifying a ELF file
    - ELF files start with the byte sequence: 7F 45 4C 46
    EG.
        xxd -l 4 filename | grep '7f454c46'

            OR
        hexdump -n 4 filename | grep '7f454c46'

7. Identifying a TAR file
    - TAR files contain the string "ustar" at byte offset 257.
    EG.
        xxd -s 257 -l 5 filename | grep '7573746172'

            OR
        hexdump -s 257 -n 5 filename | grep '7573746172'

8. Identifying a BMP file
    - BMP files start with the byte sequence: 42 4D
    EG.
        xxd -l 2 filename | grep '424d'

            OR
        hexdump -n 2 filename | grep '424d'

9. Identifying a WAV file
    - WAV files start with the byte sequence: 52 49 46 46
    EG.
        xxd -l 4 filename | grep '52494646'

            OR
        hexdump -n 4 filename | grep '52494646'

10. Identifying a MP3 file
    - MP3 files often start with the byte sequence: FF FB
    EG.
        xxd -l 2 filename | grep 'fffb'

            OR
        hexdump -n 2 filename | grep 'fffb'

11. Identifying a bzip2 file
    - bzip2 files start with the byte sequence: 42 5A 68
    EG.
        xxd -l 3 filename | grep '425a68'

            OR
        hexdump -n 3 filename | grep '425a68'

- Note:
    - While xxd and hexdump can help identify file types based on their signatures, using the file command is often a more straightforward approach for this purpose, as it is specifically designed to identify file types.
