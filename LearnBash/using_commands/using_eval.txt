                    EVAL
                ===========
- This is a powerful tool that allows you to dynamically execute strings as shell commands. 
- It takes a string as its argument and interprets it as a series of Bash commands. 
- Anything within 
    > the string,
    > including variables,
    > operators,
    > and other expressions, will be evaluated and executed by the shell.


- Constructing Commands dynamically.
    EG.
        command_name="ls"
        argument="-l"
        eval "$command_name $argument"  # Equivalent to: ls -l


- Variable Indirection (Advanced)
    EG.
        var_name="my_variable"
        my_variable="hello"
        eval "echo \$$var_name"  # Equivalent to: echo hello (prints the value of my_variable)


- Expanding a path.
    EG.
        var_path="~/script1.sh"
        eval echo $var_path # expands to /home/mark/script1.sh
