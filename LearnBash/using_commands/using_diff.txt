                    DIFF
                ============
- this is a command-line utility in Unix-like operating systems that is used to:
    >> compare the contents of two files line by line 
    >> display the differences between them.


- By default, diff cares about capitalization. 
    EG.
        # to ignore capitalization 
        diff -i file1.txt file2.txt 


-if you don't care about extra spaces, use:
    EG.
        diff -b file1.txt file2.txt 


- you can compare two entire folders using:
    EG.
        diff -r folder1 folder2 


- if you just want to know if the files are different without seeing the details 
    EG.
        diff -q file1.txt file2.txt 

            - it will simply say "Files Differ" or stay silent if they are identical.


- The default output looks like this:
    __________________________________________________________
    | SYMBOLS | WHAT IT MEANS                                |
    |---------|----------------------------------------------|
    |   c     | change : a line was modified.                |
    |   a     | Append : a line was added.                   |
    |   d     | Delete : a line was removed.                 |
    |   <     | Refers to the first file (the "left" side).  |
    |   >     | Refers to the second file (the "right" side) |
    |  ---    | the seperator between the two files.         |

        EG.
            Decoding 2c2:
                * This means "At line 2, change the original line 2."

            Decoding 3a4:
                * This means " after line 3 of the first file, append line 4 from the second file."


            list1.txt
                - Apples
                - Milk
                - Bread
            
            list2.txt.
                - Apples.
                - Oat milk 
                - Bread.
                - Eggs.

            diff list1.txt list2.txt 

                * OUTPUT.
                    2c2

        THE UNIFIED FORMAT.
    ------------------------
- The "Normal" output above is a bit old-school.
- Most developers use the Unified Format because it's much easier to read and is what you'll see on sites like Github.
    EG.
        diff -u list1.txt list2.txt 

            * OUTPUT.
                --- list1.txt
