                        COMMAND.
                    ================
- is a shell builtin in Bash (and POSIX shells). Its primary jobs are:
    > Bypass functions or aliases: If youâ€™ve defined a function or alias named ls, command ls runs the real external /bin/ls.
    > Check for existence: With -v or -V, you can see where a name comes from.
    > Invoke builtins explicitly: Though rarely needed, you can force a builtin rather than an external program.


        EXAMPLES
    ----------------
1. Run the real ls even if you have a alias.
    EG.
        alias ls='ls --color=auto'
        command ls /etc 

            > what happens
                ignores your ls alias and runs the system's ls on /etc.


2. check what grep refers to 
    EG.
        command -v grep 

            > what happens 
                Prints the path to grep (e.g /usr/bin/grep) or "grep" if its a shell builtin.


3. see verbose origin.
    EG.
        command -V cd 

            > what happens.
                Tells you that cd is a shell builtin, not an external command.
