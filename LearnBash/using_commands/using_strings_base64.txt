                STRINGS COMMAND
             =====================
- we can extract readable strings from binary files using the `strings` command.
- it is useful for analyzing binary files to find embedded text.
    EG.
        strings filename.

            - it will display all the human-readable strings found in the binary file `filename`.
            - to extract strings from a binary file and save them to a text file, you can use:
                EG.
                    strings binaryfile.bin > output.txt
        
            - to convert a human readable file to binary format, you can use the `xxd` command:
                EG.
                    xxd -b humanreadable.txt > binaryfile.bin

                        - the `-b` option tells `xxd` to create a binary dump.
                        - If you convert a human-readable text file to binary format using `xxd` and then use the `strings` command on the resulting binary file, the `strings` command will extract and display the original human-readable text that was present in the text file. This is because the binary representation created by `xxd` still contains the original text data, and `strings` is able to identify and extract those printable characters.
        

                BASE64 
              ===========
we can encode and decode using base 64.
    
    1) decoding 
        EG.
            base64 -d data.txt
            
    2) encode 
        EG.
            base64 data.txt
