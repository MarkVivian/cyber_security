                                SU 
                            ========
- The su command (short for "substitute user" or "switch user") is used to switch to another user account in a Unix-like operating system.


            USAGE
        -----------------
1) switch between users in a machine.
    EG.
        sudo su username --> sudo su steve 

            - You'll be prompted for steve's password.
            - Once authenticated you will be switched to steve's user environment.


2) Switching to root user.
    EG.
        su 

            - you will be prompted for the root password.
            - After authentication, you will have root privileges.


3) Switching with `-` option.
    EG.
        # to switch to user `steve` with steve's environment.
        su - steve 

            - The - option (or --login) simulates a full login as the specified user.
            - It starts a new login shell with the environment variables and settings of that user.
            - It also changes to the user’s home directory.


4) Switching to Root with full login.
    EG.
        su -

            - This will give you the root user’s environment, which includes root’s home directory and environment variables.


5) Running a command as another user.
    EG.
        su -c 'command' [username] 
            EG.
                 # To list the contents of Steve’s home directory.
                 su -c 'ls /home/steve' steve 

                    - The -c option allows you to run a specific command as the specified user without starting a full login shell.

        - switching to root and running a command.
            EG.
                su -c 'apt update'

                    - This runs the apt update command as root without starting an interactive root shell.
