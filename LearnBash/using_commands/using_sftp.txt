                                        SFTP (Secure File Transfer Protocol)
                                    -----------------------------------------
- Provides secure, interactive file transfer over SSH.
- Unlike scp, it:
    > lets you browse remote directories.
    > Supports resumabble transfers.
    > Has built-in commands (ls, cd, put, get, etc.) for file management.
    > Is safer by design than legacy scp.

- Common options:
    -P port : specify the port.
    -i keyfile : private key.
    -o option=value : SSH config options.
    -F configfile : alternative ssh config file.
    -J user@jump : jump host.
    -v : verbose/debug.
    -C : Compression.
    -r : recursive (used with put/get for directories).
    -p : preserve times/permisions.
    -l limit : bandwidth limit in Kbit/s.
    -b batchfile : read commands from a file for non-interactive.
    -B buffer_size : set buffer size for transfers.

- Two modes of use:
    1. Interactive mode (most common)
    2. Batch/non-interactive mode (using -b with a file of commands).


                USAGE.
            -------------
1. Interactive mode : 
    EG.
        sftp username@remote_host

            > opens an interactive SFTP session.
            > use commands like:
                * Navigation commands.
                    - ls : list remote files.
                    - !ls : list local files.
                    - !cd directory : change local directory.
                        NOTE : adding ! before a command runs it on the local machine.
                    - cd directory : change remote directory.
                    - lcd directory : change local directory.
                    - pwd : print remote working directory.
                    - lpwd : print local working directory.
                    - lls : list local files.

                * File transfer commands.
                    - get remote_file [local_file] : download file.
                    - get -r remote_directory [local_directory] : download directory recursively.
                    - mget remote_file1 remote_file2 : download multiple files.
                    - reget remote_file : resume interrupted download.
                    - reput local_file : resume interrupted upload.
                    - put local_file [remote_file] : upload file.
                    - put -r local_directory [remote_directory] : upload directory recursively.
                    - mput local_files : upload multiple files.
                    - rename oldname newname : rename remote file.
                    - rm remote_file : delete remote file.
                    - rmdir remote_directory : remove remote directory.
                    - mkdir remote_directory : create remote directory.
                    - stat remote_file : display remote file info.
                    - exit or bye : close the SFTP session.
                    - chmod 644 remote_file : change permissions of remote file to 644.
                    - chown user:group remote_file : change owner and group of remote file.
