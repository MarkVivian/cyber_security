                                    TR COMMAND
                            =====================
- This command is used to manipulate character sets within text streams.
- It can be used for tasks such as translating characters, deleting characters, and squeezing repeated characters.
- The basic syntax is:
        tr [options] SET1 [SET2]


                    USAGE
                =================
1) Convert lowercase to uppercase.
    EG.
        echo "hello world" | tr 'a-z' 'A-Z'

            - will output "HELLO WORLD"


2. camel case to swap case
    EG.
        echo "Hello World" | tr 'a-zA-Z' 'A-Za-z'

            - will output "hELLO wORLD"


2) Delete all digits.
    EG.
        echo "User1234" | tr -d '0-9'

            - will output "User"


3) Replace spaces with:
    i. underscores.
        EG.
            echo "hello world" | tr ' ' '_'

                - will output "hello_world"

    ii. shifting characters.
        EG.
            echo "abcdefg" | tr 'a-z' 'b-za'

                - will output "bcdefgh"
                - each character is replaced by the next character in the alphabet, with 'z' wrapping around to 'a'.
                - The sets must be of equal length when translating characters.
                - why not 'a-z' 'b-a'?
                    * because 'b-a' is not a valid range, ranges must be in ascending order.
                - Why 'b-za'? 
                    * because it ensures that 'z' wraps around to 'a', maintaining the length of the character set.

    iii. ROT13 encoding.
        EG.
            echo "Hello World" | tr 'a-zA-Z' 'n-za-mN-ZA-M'

                - will output "Uryyb Jbeyq"
                - ROT13 is a simple letter substitution cipher that replaces a letter with the 13th letter after it in the alphabet.
                - It is commonly used to obscure text, such as spoilers or puzzle solutions.
                - why 'a-zA-Z'?
                    * because it includes both lowercase and uppercase letters for the substitution.
                - why 'n-za-mN-ZA-M'?
                    * because it shifts each letter by 13 positions in the alphabet, wrapping around at the end.
                - To decode ROT13, you can apply the same command again:
                    EG.
                        echo "Uryyb Jbeyq" | tr 'a-zA-Z' 'n-za-mN-ZA-M'

                            - will output "Hello World"

    iv. Squeeze repeated characters.
        EG.
            echo "aaabbbcccaaa" | tr -s 'a'

                - will output "abbbccca"
                - the `-s` option squeezes consecutive occurrences of the specified character into a single occurrence.
