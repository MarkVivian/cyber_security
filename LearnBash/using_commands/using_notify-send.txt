                            NOTIFY SEND.
                        ==================
- is a command-line tool for sending desktop notifications to the user via a notification daemon.
- These notifications are lightweight and can display events or information without interrupting the user.

                
                BASIC SYNTAX.
            -------------------
EG.
    notify-send [OPTIONS] "Summary" "Body"

        - Summary: The title of the notification.
        - Body: Additional text or details (optional).


            COMMON USES.
        -------------------
1. Sending a Basic Notification
    - Use the default settings to send a notification with just a title and optional body text.
        EG:
            notify-send "Backup Complete" "Your backup finished successfully."
            
                - Displays a notification with the title "Backup Complete" and the body "Your backup finished successfully."


2. Setting the App Name
    - Specify the application name to show as the sender of the notification.
        EG:
            notify-send -a "BackupApp" "Backup Complete" "All files have been saved."
            
                -a "BackupApp": Sets the app name to BackupApp. This can help the user identify where the notification originated.


3. Adding Actions to Notifications
    - Provide actionable options in the notification (requires the user to interact).
        EG:
            notify-send -A "retry=Retry" -A "cancel=Cancel" "Connection Error" "Do you want to retry?"

                -A "retry=Retry": Adds an action button labeled Retry.
                -A "cancel=Cancel": Adds an action button labeled Cancel.
                The selected action (e.g., "retry" or "cancel") will be printed to stdout.


4. Setting Urgency Levels
    - Set the priority level of the notification (low, normal, critical).
        EG:
            notify-send -u critical "Low Battery" "Please plug in your charger."

                -u critical: Marks the notification as critical, which might persist or be styled differently depending on the notification daemon.


5. Controlling Expiration Time
    - Set how long (in milliseconds) the notification should be displayed.
        EG
            notify-send -t 10000 "Reminder" "Meeting starts in 10 minutes."

                -t 10000: Sets the display time to 10 seconds (10000 ms).
                Note: Some desktop environments (e.g., GNOME) ignore this option.


6. Adding Icons
    - Display a notification with a custom or stock icon.
        EG:
            notify-send -i "/usr/share/icons/gnome/256x256/emotes/face-smile.png" "Hello!" "Have a great day!"

                -i "/path/to/icon.png": Specifies the icon to display with the notification. This can be a full path or a stock icon name.


7. Replacing an Existing Notification
    - Update an ongoing notification by replacing it using its ID.
        EG:
            notify-send -r 1234 "Download in Progress" "50% complete..."
                
                -r 1234: Replaces the notification with ID 1234. This is useful for progress updates.


8. Waiting for Notification Closure
    - Block the command from exiting until the notification is dismissed or expires.
        EG
            notify-send -w "Task Complete" "You can now close this."
                
                -w: Waits for the notification to close before the script or command exits.


9. Adding Hints
    - Send additional data to the notification daemon using hints.
        EG:
            notify-send -h int:transient:1 "Temporary Message" "This message won't persist."
    
                -h int:transient:1: Sets the notification to be transient, meaning it wonâ€™t persist in a notification center.
