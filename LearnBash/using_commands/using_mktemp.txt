                    MKTEMP
                ==============
- The mktemp command is used to create temporary files and directories in a secure manner. 
- This is especially useful in scripts where you need to create unique temporary files or directories to avoid name collisions or security issues.
- How does mktemp work?
    - When you run mktemp, it generates a unique filename or directory name based on a specified template or a default template if none is provided.
    - The generated name typically includes random characters to ensure uniqueness.
    - mktemp then creates the file or directory and returns its name, which can be used in your script.
- How it helps in scripting:
    - Avoids name collisions: Each time you run mktemp, it generates a unique name, preventing conflicts with existing files or directories.
    - Enhances security: By creating temporary files in a secure manner, mktemp helps prevent vulnerabilities that could arise from predictable filenames.
    - Simplifies cleanup: Temporary files and directories created with mktemp can be easily identified and removed after they are no longer needed.


- basic usage.
    EG.
        mktemp [OPTION] [template]

            - Template
                > A string that includes at least 3 consecutive 'X' characters.
                > The X will be replaced by a unique combination of letters and numbers.
                > if no template is provided, it used the default template and places the file in /tmp directory.


- Creating a temporary file.
    EG.
        mktemp


- Creating a temporary directory.
    EG.
        mktemp -d


- Creating a directory with templates.
    EG.
        mktemp -d /tmp/filename.XXXX

            - the XXX will be replaced by unique combination of characters.
