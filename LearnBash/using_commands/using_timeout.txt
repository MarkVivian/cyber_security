                TIMEOUT
            ================
- The timeout command in Linux is used to run a command with a time limit. 
- If the command runs longer than the specified duration, timeout terminates it. 
- This is useful for ensuring that commands or scripts do not hang indefinitely.


- Basic Usage.  
    EG.
        timeout [OPTION] DURACTION COMMAND [ARG]

            - duration  
                > the time limit for the command.
                > it can be specified in various units:
                    s for seconds.
                    m for minutes.
                    d for days.

                    - the default is seconds.


- Run a command with a time limit of 2 minutes.
    EG.
        timeout 2m command


- Run a command with a time limit of 5 seconds.
    EG.
        timeout 5 command
            OR
        timeout 5s command.

    
- Handling Exit Status.
    > The exit status of `timeout` is:
        124: If timeout itself terminated the command.
        125: If there was some error invoking timeout.
        126: If the command was found but could not be invoked.
        127: If the command could not be found.
        The exit status of the command: If it finished before the timeout.

            EG.
                timeout 5 your-command
                status=$?
                if [ $status -eq 124 ]; then
                    echo "Command timed out"
                elif [ $status -eq 0 ]; then
                    echo "Command completed successfully"
                else
                    echo "Command failed with exit status $status"
                fi


- using the -s option to specify a signal.
    - By default, timeout sends a SIGTERM signal to terminate the command. 
    - You can specify a different signal with the -s option.
        EG.
            # send a SIGKILL signal after 5 second.
            timeout -s SIGKILL 5 your-command.


- -k duration usage (--kill-after=duration)
    - Also send a KILL signal if the command is still running this long after the initial signal was sent.
        EG.
            timeout -k 10s 5s your_command.

                - This sends a TERM signal after 5 seconds, 
                - and if the command is still running after another 10 seconds, it sends a KILL signal.


- -s signal usage (--signal=SIGNAL)
    - specify the signal to be sent on timeout.
        EG.
            timeout -s SIGKILL 5 your-command


- --preserve-status 
    - Exit with the same status as COMMAND, even when the command times out.
        EG.
            timeout --preserve-status 5 your-command


- --foreground
    - When not running timeout directly from a shell prompt, allow COMMAND to read from the TTY and get full job control.
        EG.
            timeout --foreground 5 your_command.
