            TAR
        =============
- tar basically stands for "tape archive" and is a widely used command-line utility for creating and managing archive files in Unix-like operating systems.
- It does zero compression:
    * if you have a 1GB folder, a tar file of that folder will be 1GB (plus a tiny bit of metadata)

- It is mostly used for archiving:
    * multiple files and folders into one tar file.
    * folders to be compressed since gzip, bzip2 etc can't compress folders.

- what is the difference between zip and tar(tap archive):
    * zip is a convenience format. It does the archiving and the compression in one go.
    * however it's bad at preserving Linux-specific permissions (like the SetUID).
    * tar was built for linux/unix systems, so it remembers exactly who own what file.

- identified by :  
    * the tar, tar.gz, tar.bz2 extension 
        > btw the file's extension is just a courtesy for humans, it doesn't matter to linux.
        > Meaning if you rename a "file.tar.gz" to "totally_not_a_archive", the tar command will still work.
    * first two bytes are "75 73 74 61 72" in hexadecimal

    - this can be found by running:
        EG.
            xxd ./filename | grep '7573746172'

                OR

            xxd -s 257 -l 5 ./filename | grep '7573746172'
                
                 -l 5 means to print only the first 5 words . 
                 -s 257 means to start reading from byte offset 257. 
                -this will display the first lines of the file.

                OR
            
            file ./filename
                
                - this will display the compression algorithm used.

- Parameters:
    -c : create an archive.
    -x : Extract an archive
    -v : Verbose (show me the files as it works).
    -z : use gzip.
    -f : File (the next thing i type is the name of the file)


                USAGE.
            --------------
1. Basic compression and decompression
    - compresses data using the:
        EG.
            Create: tar -cvf archive.tar filename1 filename2

                OR

            Create with gzip: tar -czvf archive.tar.gz filename1 filename2

                OR

            Create with bzip2: tar -cjvf archive.tar.bz2 filename1 filename2

        
    - decompress data using:
        EG.
            Extract: tar -xvf archive.tar

                * this command will also extract compressed data like tar.gz or tar.bz2.
                * modern tar automatically detects the compression if any was used and handles it automatically.

                OR

            Extract with gzip: tar -xzvf archive.tar.gz

                OR

            Extract with bzip2: tar -xjvf archive.tar.bz2

                * What is the -v option doing?
                    - The -v option stands for "verbose." 
                    - When you use the -v option with the tar command, it provides detailed output of the files being processed during the creation or extraction of the archive. 
                    - This means that as tar processes each file, it will print the name of the file to the terminal, allowing you to see which files are being added to or extracted from the archive in real-time.


2. Viewing contents of a tar file without extracting
    EG.
        tar -tvf archive.tar

            * this command will also allow you to view compressed tar files like tar.gz or tar.bz2 

            OR

        tar -tzvf archive.tar.gz

            OR

        tar -tjvf archive.tar.bz2


3. Extracting specific files from a tar archive
    EG.
        # only get filename from the archive
        tar -xvf archive.tar /path/to/filename

            * this command will also allow you to view compressed tar files like tar.gz or tar.bz2  

            OR

        tar -xzvf archive.tar.gz /path/to/filename

            OR

        tar -xjvf archive.tar.bz2 /path/to/filename


4. Creating a tar archive from a directory
    EG.
        tar -cvf archive.tar /path/to/directory

            OR

        tar -czvf archive.tar.gz /path/to/directory

            OR

        tar -cjvf archive.tar.bz2 /path/to/directory


5. Adding files to an existing tar archive
    - can be achieved using the -r (append) or -u (update) options.
    - The -r option will add files to the end of the archive, while the -u option will only add files that are newer than the existing files in the archive.
    - You cannot add files to a compressed tar archive (like tar.gz or tar.bz2) using the -r or -u options.
        EG.
            # using the -r option to add filename3 to archive.tar
            tar -rvf archive.tar filename3

                * this command will also allow you to add files to compressed tar files like tar.gz or tar.bz2 

                OR

            # using the -u option to add filename3 to archive.tar only if it's newer than the existing file in the archive.
            tar -uvf archive.tar filename3
