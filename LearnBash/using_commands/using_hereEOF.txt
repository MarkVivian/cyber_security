                ================
- This are a way to inject multi-line text into commands within your terminal. 
- They're useful in shell scripting where you'd need to create a separate file.


- Basic syntax.
    EG.
        command << EOF 
            your multiple lines here.
        EOF

            - command (optional):
                > This is the command that will receive the content of your here document. 
                > Common examples include cat, mail, or even custom scripts.
            <<: 
                > This redirection operator indicates the start of the here document.
            EOF (or any unique identifier): 
                > This is the delimiter that marks the end of the here document. 
                > It should appear on a new line by itself and shouldn't be indented. 


1. Creating Multi-line Text files.
    - Imagine you want to create a quick text file with some content. 
    - You can use cat with a here document:
        EG.
            cat << EOF << file.txt
            This is some content.
            For my new text file.
            EOF

                - This creates a file named myfile.txt with the specified content.
