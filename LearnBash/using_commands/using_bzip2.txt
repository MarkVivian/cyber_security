                            BZIP2
                        =============
- Compression progression:
    |  tool | Speed     | Compression Ratio | 
    |-------|-----------|-------------------|
    | gzip  | Fast      | Moderate          |
    | bzip2 | Slow      | High              |
    | xz    | Very Slow | Very High         |

- bzip2 is a popular data compression algorithm that is known for its high compression ratio and efficiency.
- It is widely used for compressing files and data streams in Unix-like operating systems.
- bzip2 uses the Burrows-Wheeler transform and Huffman coding to achieve effective compression.
- bzip2 is particularly effective for compressing large text files, source code, and other types of data where redundancy can be exploited.
- bzip2 files are typically identified by the .bz2 extension and the first two bytes being "42 5A 68" in hexadecimal.
    > identified by :  
        * the bz2 extension 
        * first two bytes are "42 5A 68" in hexadecimal

            - this can be found by running:
                EG.
                    xxd ./filename | head | grep '425a68' 

                        OR

                    xxd -l 2 ./filename | grep '425a68' # xxd -l 2 means to print only the first 2 words . 
                        
                        -this will display the first lines of the file.

                        OR
                    
                    file ./filename
                        
                        - this will display the compression algorithm used.


                    USAGE.
                -----------------
1. Basic compression and decompression
    - compresses data using the:
        EG.
            bzip2 ./filename


    - decompress data using:
        EG.
            bunzip2 ./filename.bz2

                OR

            bzip2 -d filename.bz2


2. Viewing contents of a bzip2 file without decompressing
    EG.
        bzcat filename.bz2

            - This command outputs the uncompressed contents of the bzip2 file to standard output without actually decompressing the file on disk.
        
            OR

        bzip2 -c -d filename.bz2

            - The -c option tells bzip2 to write the decompressed data to standard output instead of creating a file.
            - The -d option specifies decompression.


3. Compressing with maximum compression
    EG.
        bzip2 -9 filename

            - The -9 option tells bzip2 to use the highest level of compression, which may take more time but results in a smaller file size.
            - The range is from -1 (fastest, least compression) to -9 (slowest, most compression).


4. Keeping the original file after compression
    EG.
        bzip2 -k filename

            - The -k option tells bzip2 to keep the original file after compression, resulting in both the original and compressed files being present.


5. Compressing multiple files into a single bzip2 file
    EG.
        tar -cjf archive.tar.bz2 file1 file2 file3

            - The tar command is used to create an archive of multiple files.
            - The -c option creates a new archive.
            - The -j option compresses the archive using bzip2.


6. Testing the integrity of a bzip2 file
    EG.
        bzip2 -t filename.bz2

            - The -t option tells bzip2 to test the integrity of the compressed file without decompressing it.
            - If the file is intact, there will be no output; if there are errors, they will be reported.
