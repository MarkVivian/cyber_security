                ECHO 
        =================
- Sending data without newline:
    EG.
        echo -n "your message"

- The ‘-e’ option with the echo command enables the interpretation of backslash escapes.
- Backslash escapes are sequences of characters that are interpreted to represent special characters. 
- For instance, ‘\n’ represents a newline.
    EG.
        echo -e "message 1 \n message 2"


        Adding Colors
    -------------------------
To add colors, you use ANSI escape codes.
    EG.
        echo -e "\e[32mHello, World!\e[0m"  # Green text
            
            > Explanation of ANSI Escape Codes
                \e[: Starts the escape sequence.
                32m: Sets the text color to green.
                \e[0m: Resets the text color to default.
