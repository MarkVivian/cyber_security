        --------------------
    EG.

-a or --all:

-h or --human-readable: 
    > Displays disk space usage in human-readable format (e.g., GB, MB, etc.).

-i or --inodes:
    > Displays disk space usage with inode information.

-T or --print-type:

-x or --exclude-type:

            USAGES.
        ---------------
1. Displaying disk space usage of all file systems
    EG.
        df

            - This will display the disk space usage of all file systems.


2. Displaying disk space usage of a specific file system
    EG.
        df /dev/sda1

            - This will display the disk space usage of the /dev/sda1 file system.


3. Displaying disk space usage in human-readable format
    EG.
        df -h

            - This will display the disk space usage of all file systems in human-readable format.


4. Displaying disk space usage with inode information
    EG.
        df -i

            - This will display the disk space usage of all file systems with inode information.


5. Displaying disk space usage with file system type information
    EG.
        df -T

            - This will display the disk space usage of all file systems with file system type information.


6. Excluding file systems of a specific type from the output
    EG.
        df -x tmpfs

            - This will display the disk space usage of all file systems, excluding file systems of type tmpfs.
