                GREP COMMAND
            =========================
we can get a specific character using:
    EG.
        grep "value to look for" ./file
        
            - it will show the content of file that matches.
        
        
we can also avoid specific characters using:
    EG.
        grep -v "don't show this" ./file 
        
            - it will show the content of file that doesn't match.


we can also get context :
    EG.
        grep -A 2 -B 2 "error" system.log

            - This will print the line with "error" and two lines before and after it.
