                GREP COMMAND
            =========================
we can get a specific character using:
    EG.
        grep "value to look for" ./file
        
            - it will show the content of file that matches.
        
        
we can also avoid specific characters using:
    EG.
        grep -v "don't show this" ./file 
        
            - it will show the content of file that doesn't match.


we can also get context :
    EG.
        grep -A 2 -B 2 "error" system.log

            - This will print the line with "error" and two lines before and after it.


Ignore case with `-i`:
    EG.
        grep -i "hello" file.txt

            - This searches for "hello" in `file.txt`, ignoring case.


Count matches with `-c`:
    EG.
        grep -c "hello" file.txt

            - This counts the number of lines containing "Hello" in file.txt.


Show line numbers with `-n`:
    EG.
        grep -n "Hello" file.txt

            - This displays matching lines along with their line numbers.


Recursive search with `-r`:
    EG.
        grep -r "Hello" /path/to/directory

            - This searches for Hello in all files within the specified directory and its subdirectories.


quiet or silent mode `-q`:
    EG.
        grep -q "pattern" file.txt
        if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
            echo "Pattern found."
        else
            echo "Pattern not found."
        fi

            - This option tells grep not to output anything to the terminal, even if it finds a match.
            - Instead of printing the matching lines, grep -q returns a status code (stored in $?):
                - 0 if a match is found.
                - 1 if no match is found.


fixed string search.
    EG.
        echo "hello world" | grep -F "hello"

            - This option tells grep to treat the pattern as a fixed string rather than a regular expression.
            - It’s faster when you’re searching for simple strings that don’t involve regex.
            - the difference between fixed string search and regular expression search is that fixed string search looks for an exact match of the specified string, while regular expression search allows for more complex patterns and variations.
                EG.
                    echo "hello.world" | grep -F "hello.world" # Fixed String Search
                        vs
                    echo "hello.world" | grep "hello.world" # Regular Expression Search (the dot is a wildcard)
                    

searching with escape characters.
    EG.
        man dirb | grep -- "-p" # Using Double Dash
            OR 
        man dirb | grep "\-p" # Using Escape Character

            - Both methods will allow you to search for -p or any other flag in a man page without grep interpreting it as an option.


Searching multiple words.
    EG.
        grep -E 'small|big' filename.txt #  Using the OR Operator with grep
            OR
        grep -e 'small' -e 'big' filename.txt # Using -e for Multiple Patterns

            - This commands will find lines containing either "small" or "big" in filename.txt.
