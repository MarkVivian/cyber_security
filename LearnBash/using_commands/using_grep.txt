                GREP COMMAND
            =========================
we can get a specific character using:
    EG.
        grep "value to look for" ./file
        
            - it will show the content of file that matches.
        
        
we can also avoid specific characters using:
    EG.
        grep -v "don't show this" ./file 
        
            - it will show the content of file that doesn't match.


we can also get context :
    EG.
        grep -A 2 -B 2 "error" system.log

            - This will print the line with "error" and two lines before and after it.


Ignore case with `-i`:
    EG.
        grep -i "hello" file.txt

            - This searches for "hello" in `file.txt`, ignoring case.


Count matches with `-c`:
    EG.
        grep -c "hello" file.txt

            - This counts the number of lines containing "Hello" in file.txt.


Show line numbers with `-n`:
    EG.
        grep -n "Hello" file.txt

            - This displays matching lines along with their line numbers.


Recursive search with `-r`:
    EG.
        grep -r "Hello" /path/to/directory

            - This searches for Hello in all files within the specified directory and its subdirectories.


quiet or silent mode `-q`:
    EG.
        grep -q "pattern" file.txt
        if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
            echo "Pattern found."
        else
            echo "Pattern not found."
        fi

            - This option tells grep not to output anything to the terminal, even if it finds a match.
            - Instead of printing the matching lines, grep -q returns a status code (stored in $?):
                - 0 if a match is found.
                - 1 if no match is found.


fixed string search.
    EG.
        echo "hello world" | grep -F "hello"

            - This option tells grep to treat the pattern as a fixed string rather than a regular expression.
            - It’s faster when you’re searching for simple strings that don’t involve regex.


searching with escape characters.
    EG.
        man dirb | grep -- "-p" # Using Escape Character:
            OR 
        man dirb | grep "\-p" # Using Double Dash:

            - Both methods will allow you to search for -p or any other flag in a man page without grep interpreting it as an option.
