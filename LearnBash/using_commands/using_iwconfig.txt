                            IWCONFIG
                        ==============
- iwconfig is a command-line utility in Linux used for configuring and managing wireless network interfaces.
- It is part of the Wireless Tools for Linux package.
- This tool is primarily used to configure settings like the SSID, frequency, mode, and encryption settings of wireless networks.
- Unlike ifconfig, which works for all types of network interfaces, iwconfig is specialized for wireless interfaces.


                    BASIC SYNTAX.
                ------------------
EG.
    iwconfig [interface] [options]

        - [interface] is the name of the wireless interface (e.g., wlan0, wlp2s0).
        - [options] are the settings or commands to be applied.


                    KEY FIELDS AND OPTIONS IN IWCONFIG
                -----------------------------------------
1. SSID (Network Name)
    - The SSID is the name of the wireless network.
    - Use the essid option to set or display the SSID.  
        EG.
            iwconfig wlan0 essid "MyNetwork"

                - This command connects the wireless interface wlan0 to a network with the SSID "MyNetwork".
            

2. Mode
    - Specifies the mode of operation for the wireless network interface.
        > Managed: Connects to an access point (default for most Wi-Fi clients).
        > Ad-Hoc: Connects to other devices directly without an access point.
        > Monitor: Allows passive monitoring of all traffic on a channel (used for packet capturing).
            EG.
                iwconfig wlan0 mode managed
                iwconfig wlan0 mode monitor


3. Frequency/Channel
    - Sets the frequency (in GHz) or the channel number for the wireless network.
        EG:
            iwconfig wlan0 freq 2.462G
            iwconfig wlan0 channel 11

                - Channel 11 corresponds to a frequency of 2.462 GHz.


4. Bit Rate
    - Specifies the data transmission rate (e.g., 11 Mbps, 54 Mbps).
        EG:
            iwconfig wlan0 rate 54M

                - This sets the bit rate to 54 Mbps.


5. Power Management
    - Enables or disables power management to conserve battery.
        EG:
            iwconfig wlan0 power on
            iwconfig wlan0 power off


6. Encryption/Authentication
    - Configure the encryption key for WEP networks.
        EG:
            iwconfig wlan0 key 1234567890
            iwconfig wlan0 key off

                - Note: Modern networks using WPA/WPA2 are managed using tools like wpa_supplicant rather than iwconfig.


7. Signal Quality and Link Information
    - Use iwconfig without arguments to view details such as:
        > Signal level
        > Noise level
        > Link quality
            EG.
                iwconfig

                    - Displays link quality, signal strength, and other statistics for wireless interfaces.
