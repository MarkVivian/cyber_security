                                        UPOWER
                                    ==============
- This is a powerful command-line utility in Linux for monitoring power sources like batteries. 


            USAGE.
        -----------------
1) List all the power devices.
    - To see all the devices managed by `power`.
        EG.
            upower -e

                - This command lists all power sources, including batteries, AC adapters, and other related devices. 
                    EG.
                        /org/freedesktop/UPower/devices/line_power_AC
                        /org/freedesktop/UPower/devices/battery_BAT0


2) Get detailed information about the device.
    - To get detailed information about a specific device, use the -i option followed by the device path. 
        EG.
            upower -i /org/freedesktop/UPower/devices/battery_BAT0
                    OR
            upower -i $(upower -e | grep BAT)


3) Monitor battery status in real-time.
    - You can watch the battery status in real-time by running:
        EG. 
            watch -n 5 upower -i $(upower -e | grep BAT)


4) Summary of all power sources.
    EG.
        upower -d


5) Understanding battery health.
    - Battery health can be estimated by comparing the `energy-full` with the `energy-full-design`.
        EG.
            upower -i $(upower -e | grep BAT) | grep "energy-full"
            upower -i $(upower -e | grep BAT) | grep "energy-full-design"

        
                            BATTERY FILE.
                        ===================
- If you wish to check the current battery state of the device:
    EG.
        cat /sys/class/power_supply/BAT0/capacity 

        - you can also check the state using:
            EG.       
                cat /sys/class/power_supply/BAT0/status

                    > This will return the status of the battery, which can be one of the following:
                        Charging
                        Discharging
                        Full
                        Not charging


- actually most of the battery data is in:
    EG.
        /sys/class/power_supply/BAT0/
