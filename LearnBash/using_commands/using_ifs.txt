                            IFS.
                        =========
- The Internal Field Separator (IFS) is a special variable in Bash that determines how the shell splits words and fields when processing input.
- By default, IFS is set to whitespace characters: space, tab, and newline.
- This means that when you read input or process strings, Bash will treat these characters as delimiters.


                BASIC SYNTAX.
            --------------------
- You can set the IFS variable in your script as follows:
    EG.
        IFS='character'


                    USAGE.
                ---------------
1. Default Behavior
    -  When using the default IFS (whitespace), Bash splits input based on spaces, tabs, and newlines. 
        EG.
            input="Hello World"
            for word in $input; do
                echo "$word"
            done
        OUTPUT.
            Hello
            World


2. Changing IFS to a Comma 
    -  If you have a CSV file and want to read it line by line, you can change the IFS to a comma. 
        EG.
            IFS=','
            while read -r field1 field2 field3; do
                echo "Field 1: $field1"
                echo "Field 2: $field2"
                echo "Field 3: $field3"
            done < clients.csv

                -  In this example, each line of clients.csv will be split into fields based on commas. 


3. Using IFS with read
    -  You can use IFS with the read command to split input into variables. 
        EG.
            IFS=':'
            read -r user pass uid gid name home shell <<< "username:password:1001:1001:User Name:/home/username:/bin/bash"
            echo "Username: $user"
            echo "Password: $pass"
            echo "User ID: $uid"
            echo "Group ID: $gid"
            echo "Name: $name"
            echo "Home Directory: $home"
            echo "Shell: $shell"

        OUTPUT.
            Username: username
            Password: password
            User ID: 1001
            Group ID: 1001
            Name: User Name
            Home Directory: /home/username
            Shell: /bin/bash


4. reading line by line.
    EG.
        filename="text.txt"
        while IFS=read -r line; do 
            echo $line;
        done < $filename

            - We can also read multiple lines at a time.
                EG.
                    while IFS=read -r first && IFS= read -r second; do 
                        echo "1st : $first"
                        echo "2nd : $second"
                    done < $filename
