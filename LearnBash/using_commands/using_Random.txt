                                        RANDOM
                                    ================
- this is a utility that generates a random interger between 0 and 32767.

        BASIC USAGE.
    -------------------
EG.
    echo $RANDOM 

        - every time you access $RANDOM, it returns a new random number.


                USAGES.
            -------------
1) Generate a random number within a specific range.
    EG.
        random_number=$(( (RANDOM % 100) + 1 ))
        echo "Random number between 1 and 100: $random_number"

            - `RANDOM % 100` generates a number between 0 and 99
            - Adding `1` shifts the range to 1-100.


2) Generate a random number between Two Values.
    EG.
        MIN=50
        MAX=150
        random_number=$(( RANDOM % (MAX - MIN + 1) + MIN ))
        echo "Random number between $MIN and $MAX: $random_number"

            - `(MAX - MIN + 1 )` calculates the range size.
            - Adding `MIN` shifts the range to the desired minimum.


3) Generate multiple random numbers.
    EG.
        for i in {1..5}; do
            random_number=$(( RANDOM % 100 + 1 ))
            echo "Random number $i: $random_number"
        done

            - The loop runs 5 times, generating and printing a random number between 1 and 100 each time.


4) Random Selection from a List
    EG.
        choices=("apple" "banana" "cherry" "date" "elderberry")
        random_choice=${choices[$RANDOM % ${#choices[@]}]}
        echo "Random fruit: $random_choice"

            - ${#choices[@]} gives the number of items in the choices array.
            - $RANDOM % ${#choices[@]} ensures the index is within the bounds of the array.


6. Seeding $RANDOM for Reproducibility
    EG
        RANDOM=42
        for i in {1..5}; do
        echo $RANDOM
        done

            - Setting $RANDOM to a specific value (like 42) seeds the generator.
            - The sequence of numbers will be the same each time this code is run with the same seed.


7. Random Delay Example
    EG.
        delay=$(( RANDOM % 10 + 1 ))
        echo "Sleeping for $delay seconds..."
        sleep $delay
        echo "Done!"

            - sleep $delay pauses the script for a random number of seconds between 1 and 10.


8. Generating Random File Names
    EG.
        temp_file="tempfile_$RANDOM.txt"
        echo "Creating a temporary file named $temp_file"
        touch $temp_file

            - $RANDOM is appended to tempfile_ to create a unique file name.


9. Random Password Generation
    EG.
        password=$(echo $RANDOM | md5sum | head -c 8)
        echo "Generated password: $password"

            - md5sum generates an MD5 hash of the random number.
            - head -c 8 truncates the hash to the first 8 characters.
