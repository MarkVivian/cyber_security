- we use md5sum to check the validity of a file:

- we can get the md5sum of file using:
    EG.
        md5sum filename > filename.md5

            - this will store the checksum.


- once stored and want to check the validity of a file.
- but we need both the file and the .md5 file in the same directory then we run:
    EG.
        md5sum -c filename.md5

            - it will show ok if the file is still the same.
