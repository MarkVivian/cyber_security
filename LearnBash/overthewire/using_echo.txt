                ECHO 
        =================
- Sending data without newline:
    EG.
        echo -n "your message"

- The ‘-e’ option with the echo command enables the interpretation of backslash escapes.
- Backslash escapes are sequences of characters that are interpreted to represent special characters. 
- For instance, ‘\n’ represents a newline.
    EG.
        echo -e "message 1 \n message 2"


        Adding Colors
    -------------------------
To add colors, you use ANSI escape codes.
    EG.
        echo -e "\e[32mHello, World!\e[0m"  # Green text
            
            > Explanation of ANSI Escape Codes
                \e[: Starts the escape sequence.
                32m: Sets the text color to green.
                \e[0m: Resets the text color to default.


            > Available Colors
                Text Colors: 30 (Black), 31 (Red), 32 (Green), 33 (Yellow), 34 (Blue), 35 (Magenta), 36 (Cyan), 37 (White).
                Background Colors: 40 (Black), 41 (Red), 42 (Green), 43 (Yellow), 44 (Blue), 45 (Magenta), 46 (Cyan), 47 (White).

                    EG.
                        echo -e "\e[31mError: Operation failed!\e[0m"  # Red text
                        echo -e "\e[33mWarning: Disk space low!\e[0m"  # Yellow text
                        echo -e "\e[32mSuccess: Operation completed!\e[0m"  # Green text


            > Combining Colors and Formatting
                You can combine colors and add formatting like new lines (\n), tabs (\t), and more.
                    EG.
                        echo -e "\e[34mHello,\nWorld!\e[0m"  # Blue text with a new line
                        echo -e "Tab\tCharacter"  # Text with a tab character
