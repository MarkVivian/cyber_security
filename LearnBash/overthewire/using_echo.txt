                ECHO 
        =================
- Sending data without newline:
    EG.
        echo -n "your message"

- The ‘-e’ option with the echo command enables the interpretation of backslash escapes.
- Backslash escapes are sequences of characters that are interpreted to represent special characters. 
- For instance, ‘\n’ represents a newline.
    EG.
        echo -e "message 1 \n message 2"
