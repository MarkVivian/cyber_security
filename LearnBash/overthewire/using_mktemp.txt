- basic usage.
    EG.
        mktemp [OPTION] [template]

            - Template
                > A string that includes at least 3 consecutive 'X' characters.
                > The X will be replaced by a unique combination of letters and numbers.
                > if no template is provided, it used the default template and places the file in /tmp directory.
