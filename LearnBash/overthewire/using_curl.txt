        USAGE
    -------------
1) Download a File.
    EG.
        #!/bin/bash

        url="https://download.microsoft.com/download/2/7/A/27AF1BE6-DD20-4CB4-B154-EBAB8A7D4A7E/officedeploymenttool_17531-20046.exe"
        output="officedeploymenttool_17531-20046.exe"

        curl -o $output $url


2) Making a GET Request.
    EG.
        #!/bin/bash

        url="https://api.example.com/data"
        response=$(curl -s $url)
        echo $response

            > -s : Silent mode. It makes the curl output less verbose.
            > $url : The URL to which the GET request is sent.
            > $response : Stores the response from the server.


3) Making a POST Request.
    EG.
        #!/bin/bash

        url="https://api.example.com/data"
        data='{"key1":"value1","key2":"value2"}'
        response=$(curl -s -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d "$data" $url)
        echo $response

            > -X POST : Specifies the request method as POST.
            > -H "Content-Type: application/json" : Sets the content type of the request.
            > -d "$data" : Specifies the data to be sent in the request body.
