                    NMAP (NETWORK MAPPER)
                    =====
- Nmap is used to scan network and:
    1. find all devices connected
    2. find open ports in specific ip's.

- Normally, Nmap sends ICMP echo requests (pings) and other probes (such as TCP SYN to port 443 and TCP ACK to port 80) to determine if a host is up before scanning it.


                    OVERVIEW
                    ======
- There are three basic types of scans that can be done:
    1. TCP connection scans (-sT)
    2. SYN "Half-open" Scans (-sS)
    3. UDP Scans (-sU)

Additionally there are several less common port scan types, some of which we will also cover (albeit in less detail). These are:
    1. TCP Null Scans (-sN)
    2. TCP FIN Scans (-sF)
    3. TCP Xmas Scans (-sX)



                                        BASIC COMMANDS
                                    ======================
>> UDP Scan : `-sU`
    -> Scans for open UDP ports. Unlike TCP, UDP is connectionless, so the scanner sends UDP packets and waits for responses.
    -> If no response is received, the port is assumed open (or filtered). An ICMP "port unreachable" message signifies the port is closed.
    -> Necessary for scanning UDP services which are common in certain protocols like DNS, SNMP, and DHCP. 
    -> UDP scanning is slower and can be more challenging due to lack of reliable response.

        EG.
            nmap -sU <ip address> ----- nmap -sU 192.168.1.1

 
 >> TCP Scan : `-sT`
    -> Used for scanning TCP ports. 
    -> It completes the TCP three-way handshake (SYN, SYN-ACK, ACK) to establish a connection. 
    -> Open ports will respond with SYN-ACK, while closed ports respond with RST.
    -> Used when SYN scan isn't possible. 
    -> This scan is more detectable and slower than SYN scan.

        EG.
            nmap -sT <ip address> ---- nmap -sU 192.168.1.1


>> Ping Scan : `-sn`
    -> Used to determine which host are up without scanning for open ports.
    -> It sends ICMP echo requests and expects ICMP echo replies.

        EG.
            nmap -sn <ip address/CIDR> --------- nmap -sn 192.168.0.1/24


>> SYN Scan : `-sS`
    -> Also known as half-open scan.
    -> It sends SYN packets and waits for SYN-ACK(open) or RST(closed) responses.
    -> It does not complete the TCP handshake, making it stealthier.
    -> Prefered for most port scans because of its stealthiness and speed.
    -> It doesn't complete the TCP handshake, so it's less likely to be logged by the target system.

        EG.
            nmap -sS <ip address> ------- nmap -sS 192.168.1.1


>> OS Detection : `-O`
    -> attempts to determine the operating system of the target by analyzing the responses to various probes.   

        EG.
            nmap -O 192.168.1.1


>> Xmas Scan : `-sX`
    -> Sends packets with the FIN, PSH and URG flags set (malformed tcp flags).
    -> Closed ports usually respond with RST, while open or filtered port may not respond.
    -> Useful for evading some firewalls and packet filtering systems. 
    -> Can be used to identify open and filtered ports in certain network environments.

        EG.
            nmap -sX 192.168.1.1


>> FIN Scan : `-sF`
    -> Sends packets with the FIN flag set. Closed ports respond with RST, while open ports usually ignore the packets.
    -> Similar to Xmas scan, itâ€™s useful for evading some firewalls and intrusion detection systems (IDS). Good for detecting open ports in a stealthy manner.

        EG.
            nmap -sF 192.168.1.1


>> Null Scan : `-sN`
    -> Sends packets with no flags set. Closed ports respond with RST, while open ports usually ignore the packets.
    -> Another stealth scan used to evade firewalls and IDS by sending non-standard packets. Useful for identifying open ports in environments where other scans are blocked.
                
        EG.
             nmap -sN 192.168.1.1


>> Version Detection : `-sV`
    -> Attempts to determine the version of the services running on open ports by sending various probes and analyzing the responses.
                
        EG.
             nmap -sV 192.168.1.1

>> Verbose Mode : `-v`
    -> Increases the verbosity of the output. Provides more details about the scan progress and results.
                
        EG.
             nmap -v 192.168.1.1

>> More Verbose Mode : `-vv`
    -> Even more detailed output than -v. Useful for troubleshooting or understanding detailed scan processes.
                
        EG.
             nmap -vv 192.168.1.1


>> Output in All Formats : `-oA`
    -> Saves the scan results in three formats: normal, XML, and grepable.
                
        EG.
             nmap -oA scan_results 192.168.1.1


>> Normal Output : `-oN`
    -> Saves the scan results in a human-readable format.
                
        EG.
             nmap -oN scan_results.txt 192.168.1.1


>> Grepable Output : `-oG`
    -> Saves the scan results in a grep-friendly format.
                
        EG.
             nmap -oG scan_results.gnmap 192.168.1.1


>> Aggressive Scan : `-A`
    -> Enables OS detection, version detection, script scanning, and traceroute. Provides comprehensive information about the target.
                
        EG.
             nmap -A 192.168.1.1


>> Timing Template : `-T<0-5>`
    -> Adjusts the timing and performance of the scan. Higher values increase speed but reduce stealth.

        EG.
             nmap -T4 192.168.1.1


>> Port Specification : `-p <port number>`
    -> Specifies which ports to scan. Can scan individual ports, ranges, or all ports.
                
        EG.
             nmap -p 80 192.168.1.1
                OR
             nmap -p 80,433 192.168.1.1
                
        EG.
             nmap -p 100-150 192.168.1.1
                
        EG.
             nmap -p- 192.168.1.1


>> No Ping : `-Pn`
    -> Treats all hosts as online and skips host discovery (ICMP echo requests).
    -> scanning a network where firewalls block ICMP echo requests and other common host discovery probes.
    -> ensures that no hosts are missed in your scan, even if they are configured not to respond to pings.

        EG.
             nmap -Pn 192.168.1.1


>> Scan Top Ports : `--top-ports`
    -> Scans the most commonly used ports. Useful for quick scans of the most likely open ports.
                
        EG.
             nmap --top-ports 100 192.168.1.1


>> Script Scan : `-sC`
    -> Runs default Nmap scripts against the target. Useful for vulnerability detection and additional information gathering.
                
        EG.
             nmap -sC 192.168.1.1

>> Specific Script Scan : `--script <script name>`
    -> Runs a specific Nmap script against the target.
                
        EG.
             nmap --script http-title 192.168.1.1


>> IPv6 Scan : `-6`
    -> Enables scanning of IPv6 addresses.
                
        EG.
             nmap -6 2001:db8::1


>> Idle Scan : `-sI`
    -> Uses a third-party host (zombie) to send packets, making the scan very stealthy.
                
        EG.
             nmap -sI zombie_host 192.168.1.1


>> FTP Bounce Scan : `-b`
    -> Uses FTP servers to bounce scans off, which can help bypass some firewalls.
                
        EG.
             nmap -b ftp.example.com 192.168.1.1


>> Traceroute : `--traceroute`
    -> Traces the network path to the target.
                
        EG.
             nmap --traceroute 192.168.1.1
