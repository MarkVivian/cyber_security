                    SYMBOLIC LINK
                ===================
- The `ln` command in Unix is used to create links between files.  
- There are two types of links:
    1) Hard links: 
        - Point directly to the inode of a file. 
        - They act like the original file and donâ€™t break if the original file is moved or renamed.

    2) Symbolic (or soft) links:
        - Point to the name of the file rather than its inode. 
        - They can span different filesystems and directories, but they break if the target file is moved or deleted.


            USAGE
            ======
> Creating a hard link.
    EG.
        ln source_file target_link

            - only work for files within the same file system.


> Creating a symbolic link.
    EG.
        ln -s source_file target_link

            - it can span different file systems and directories.
