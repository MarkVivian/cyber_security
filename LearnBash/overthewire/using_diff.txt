                    DIFF
                ============
this is a command-line utility in Unix-like operating systems that is used to:
    >> compare the contents of two files line by line 
    >> display the differences between them.

    EG.
        diff file1.txt file2.txt

           - we can have two types of outputs:
                2d1
                    - where line 2 from file1 has been deleted and should be replaced with line 1 from file2

                2c2
                    - where line 2 from file1 has been changed from line 2 from file2
