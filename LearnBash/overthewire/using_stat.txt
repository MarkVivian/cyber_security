                ==========
- The stat command in Linux is used to display detailed information about files and file systems. 
- This command provides a wealth of information, including:

    > ownership,
    > permissions,
    > and timestamps, among other attributes.


- Basic Usage.
    EG.

- When you run stat on a file, it outputs detailed information. 
    EG.

            - it will typically output might look like this.
                EG.
                      File: myfile.txt
                    Size: 12345       Blocks: 24         IO Block: 4096   regular file

                            Links: The number of hard links to the file.
                            Access: The file permissions, user ID (UID), and group ID (GID).
                            Access: The last access time.

                            Change: The last status change time.
                            Birth: The file creation time (not supported on all file systems).`


- You can use options to display specific info.
    - `-c` or `--format` : specify the format of the output.
    - `-t` or `--terse` : output info in a terse form.
    - `--printf` : Similar to `--format`, but allows you to use `printf` -style formatting.


- List of common format specifiers.
    %a: Access rights in octal.
    %A: Access rights in human-readable form.
    %b: Number of blocks allocated.
    %B: The size in bytes of each block reported by %b.
    %d: Device number in decimal.
    %D: Device number in hex.
    %f: Raw mode in hex.
    %F: File type.
    %g: Group ID of owner.
    %G: Group name of owner.
    %h: Number of hard links.
    %i: Inode number.
    %m: Mount point.
    %n: File name.
    %N: Quoted file name with dereference if symbolic link.
    %s: Total size, in bytes.
    %t: Major device type in hex.
    %T: Minor device type in hex.
    %u: User ID of owner.
    %U: User name of owner.
    %x: Time of last access.
    %y: Time of last modification.
    %z: Time of last change.

        - Display file size and modification time.
            EG.
                stat --format="%s %y" myfile.txt

                    - This will output.
                        EG.
