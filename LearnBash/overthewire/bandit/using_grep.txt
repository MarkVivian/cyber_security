                GREP COMMAND
            =========================
we can get a specific character using:
    EG.
        grep "value to look for" ./file
        
            - it will show the content of file that matches.
        
        
we can also avoid specific characters using:
    EG.
        grep -v "don't show this" ./file 
        
            - it will show the content of file that doesn't match.
