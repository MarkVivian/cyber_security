                        FILE SYSTEM.
                    ===================
- A file system defines how data is stored and accessed on a storage device.
- It organizes data into files and directories, providing a structure and rules for managing that data.

        Journaling: Helps protect against data corruption.
        Supports large files and volumes.
        Improved performance and reliability over ext3.

    Use Case: General-purpose use on desktops and servers.


2. XFS

    Purpose: High-performance file system.

    Features:
        Journaling.
        Efficient handling of large files.
        Scalable and supports parallel I/O operations.

    Use Case: Enterprise-level applications, large-scale storage systems.


3. Btrfs (B-Tree File System)

    Purpose: Modern file system with advanced features.

    Features:
        Snapshots and rollbacks.
        RAID support.
        Data deduplication.
        Self-healing mechanisms.

    Use Case: Systems requiring advanced data management features, backup solutions.


4. FAT32

    Purpose: Simple and widely compatible file system.

    Features:
        Supported by almost all operating systems.
        Limited to 4GB maximum file size and 8TB maximum volume size.

    Use Case: USB drives, memory cards, and other removable media for cross-platform compatibility.


5. NTFS (New Technology File System)

    Purpose: Default file system for Windows.

    Features:
        Journaling.
        Supports large files and volumes.
        Advanced features like file compression and encryption.

    Use Case: Dual-boot systems with Windows, external hard drives.


6. exFAT (Extended File Allocation Table)

    Purpose: Optimized for flash drives.

    Features:
        Overcomes FAT32 limitations (supports larger files and volumes).
        Less overhead than NTFS.

    Use Case: USB drives, SD cards, and other portable storage.
