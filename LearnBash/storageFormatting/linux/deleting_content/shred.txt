                            USING SHRED 
                        ==================
- shred is used to securely delete files by overwriting them multiple times, ensuring that the data is extremely difficult to recover.


            USAGE
        ===========
EG.
    shred [options] <file or device>

        - Options for shred:
            -n <number>: Specifies the number of overwrite passes (default is 3).
            -z: Adds a final pass with zeroes to hide the shredding process.
            -v: Verbose mode, shows progress.
            -u: Truncate and remove the file after overwriting (useful for files, not devices).


- Identify the flash drive
    EG.
        lsblk

            1. Use `shred` to overwrite the flash drive.
                EG.
                    sudo shred -n 3 -z -v /dev/sdb

                        - overwrite the entire drive with random data multiple times 
                        - finish with a pass of zeroes.

                        -n 3:
                            > Overwrite 3 times with random data (the default is 3, but you can increase this number for more security).
                        
                        -z: 
                            >Adds a final overwrite with zeroes to hide the shredding process.

                        -v: 
                            >Shows progress during the operation.

                        /dev/sdb: 
                            >Specifies the flash drive to be shredded.
