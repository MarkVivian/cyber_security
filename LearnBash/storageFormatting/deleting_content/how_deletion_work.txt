                    UNDERSTANDING DELETION
                =============================
- Standard Deletion: 
    > When you delete a file using standard operating system commands (e.g., rm in Linux or sending a file to the recycle bin in Windows), 
    > the file's data is not immediately removed from the disk.

        1. File System Metadata: 
            - The operating system marks the space occupied by the file as available for new data, 
            - but the actual data remains on the disk until it is overwritten by new data.

        2. Recovery: 
            - This means that the deleted data can potentially be recovered using specialized software or techniques until it is overwritten.


Why Overwriting is Necessary:
--------------------------------
1. Prevent Data Recovery: 
    - To prevent data recovery, the actual data on the disk needs to be overwritten. 
    -Overwriting replaces the old data with new data, making the original data extremely difficult to recover.
    
2. Multiple Passes:
    - For added security, data is often overwritten multiple times with different patterns (random data, zeroes) to further obscure the original data.


How Overwriting works
------------------------
1. Single Pass Overwrite: 
    - Writes new data (e.g., zeroes or random data) over the entire area where the old data was stored.

2. Multiple Pass Overwrite: 
    - Repeats the overwrite process multiple times with different data patterns to ensure that the old data is thoroughly obfuscated.
