> Use a Multi-Boot Tool:
    - Ventoy:
        - Ventoy is a powerful tool that creates a bootable USB drive allowing you to simply copy multiple ISO files onto it.
        - Steps:
            > Download and install Ventoy on the USB drive.
            > Run the executable.
            > Copy ISO files directly to the drive.
            > When booting, a menu appears allowing you to select which ISO to boot from.
        > No need for multiple partitions or reformatting.
    
    - YUMI (Your Universal Multiboot Integrator):
        > Another tool for creating multi-boot USBs.
        > It supports various operating systems and utility tools.


> Manually Configure a Multi-Boot USB:
    - This is more advanced and involves:
        > Creating multiple partitions.
        > Writing each OS to a separate partition.
        > Configuring a bootloader (like GRUB) to allow selecting the OS at boot time.
    
    - Steps:
        > Partition the drive (as in the first section).
        > Write bootable files to each partition using tools like dd (Linux) or diskpart (Windows).
        > Install and configure GRUB to recognize all partitions
