when you get an error occures when you run the command :
		1) sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade

and get errors following the similar odder:
	ign1: 
	ign2:

then this happens:
	the handshake was not_properly terminated:

first:
	1) try the link of the deb in the file /etc/apt/sources.list:
		# this are original links.
		# deb https://deb.parrot.sh/parrot lts main contrib non-free
		# deb-src https://deb.parrot.sh/parrot lts main contrib non-free

		we use the link https://deb.parrot.sh/parrot and paste it in the browser to see if it opens anywhere.
		if it doesn't then we need to change the link from the webpage.
			https://parrotsec.org/docs/mirrors/mirrors-list/#emea-europe-middle-east-and-africa

		and get a working link.
		lets take this link for example...
			http://ftp.halifax.rwth-aachen.de/parrotsec

		then we add it to the sources.list file and comment out/remove the others.
			deb https://ftp.halifax.rwth-aachen.de/parrotsec/ parrot main contrib non-free
			deb https://ftp.halifax.rwth-aachen.de/parrotsec/ parrot-security main contrib non-free
			deb https://ftp.halifax.rwth-aachen.de/parrotsec/ parrot-backports main contrib non-free

		then run sudo apt update.
