								RECOVER PASSWORD
							===========================
	USING RECOVERY MODE
----------------------------
- Boot into recovery mode (usually available in the GRUB menu during startup).
- Choose the root shell prompt option.
- Remount the root filesystem with read-write access since by default its mountes as read-only:
	EG.
		mount -o remount,rw /

- Reset the password for a specific user (replace [username] with the actual username):
	EG.
		passwd [username]

- Set a new password when prompted.
- Reboot your machine and log in with the new password.

- we can also get all the users in a linux system using:
	EG.
		cat /etc/passwd 
			--> This will display a list of all users along with additional details like their home directory, login shell, and more.

- we can also use the getent command to retrieve info from databases, including user accounts.
	EG.
		getent passwd

- we can also use the users command to list currently logged-in users.
	EG.
		users.



	USING A LIVE USB.
-----------------------------
1. mount the root filesystem:
	EG.	
		lsblk
			
			- identiry the root partition.

			- Mount the root partition (replace `/dev/sdXn` with the actual partition)
				EG.	
					sudo mount /dev/sdXn /mnt


			- Chroot into the mounted partition.
				EG.
					sudo chroot /mnt

						- change root to the mounted filesystem.


			- Reset the password.
				EG.
					passwd username 
						
						-  Use the passwd command to reset the password for your user (replace username with your actual username)


			- Update grub.
				EG.
					update-grub 
						
						- update GRUB to ensure changes take effect.


			- Exit chroot and reboot.
				EG.
					Exit (exit the chroot environment)

					sudo umount /mnt (unmount the root partition)

					sudo reboot
