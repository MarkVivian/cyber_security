 1. Web Security Practice Platforms
    > OWASP Juice Shop:
        - An intentionally insecure web application for security training.
        - It's an open-source project that simulates a shopping site with numerous security flaws.
    
    > PortSwigger Web Security Academy:
        - Free learning and practice environment for web vulnerabilities, offering labs on various web security topics like SQL injection, XSS, and more.
    
    > Hack The Box:
        - Hack The Box has web-based challenges, and many of their retired machines offer lessons on web vulnerabilities.
        - You can work on them at your own pace.
    
    > Damn Vulnerable Web App (DVWA):
        - A PHP/MySQL web application that is damn vulnerable.
        - It helps you practice common vulnerabilities like SQL injection, XSS, file inclusion, etc.

    > bWAPP:
        - Another vulnerable web app designed to help with web application security testing.

2. Testing Operating System Vulnerabilities (for Metasploit and others)
    > VulnHub:
        - A site that provides intentionally vulnerable operating systems for practice.
        - You can download the OS images and run them in a virtual machine (like VirtualBox or VMware) to simulate attacks.
    
    > TryHackMe:
        - Although some content is paid, many rooms are free, offering vulnerable machines to practice on, including Metasploit and web hacking.
    
    > Metasploitable 2:
        - An intentionally vulnerable Linux virtual machine designed for testing and practicing Metasploit.
    
    > Virtual Hacking Labs:
        - A paid platform, but offers hands-on penetration testing labs with various OS and vulnerability types to explore, including Metasploit.
    
    > Parrot OS + Katoolin:
        - You can set up your own pentesting lab by installing Parrot Security OS and using Katoolin to install different vulnerable apps and services for practice.

3. Self-Hosted Vulnerable Environments
    > Docker Vulnerable Web Applications:
        - You can use Docker to spin up intentionally vulnerable web applications quickly.
        - Many repositories host these projects, such as OWASP Juice Shop and DVWA.
    
    > CVE Lists + Public Exploits:
        - If you're looking to practice on specific vulnerabilities, searching for CVEs and trying them on machines in VulnHub or Metasploit is a great way to learn.
